### Young Merchant
Rennin is a shrewd and incredibly intelligent man. His brilliance for politics, conversation, and world history make him an ideal business man. He made a name for himself in Asameria as the young boy who could strike a deal with the big shots. He would commonly be invited to large dinners hosted by the [[Merion]] Monarchy, and slowly became good friend with one of the princes, Cata Merion. 

### Leaving Asameria
As he grew up, the whole "war" thing was getting too tedious for Rennin. It was all about losing one shipment here and having to balance trade alongside political allegiances. On top of that, competing with neighboring states that had richer men and women with only the spoils found in Asameria, it was impossible. As a merchant and close confidant to the young prince Cata Merion of the [[Kingdom of Asameria]], the opportunity of moving and founding a new land was not something that could be passed up. And so, Rennin joined the young prince on his adventure, became one of the founders of [[Catameria]], and was granted the surname [[Meredane]] and a family manse upon the [[Stone Crown]].

### Catameria

### Modern Day
The year is 1207 PD, over 5 centuries from when Catameria was founded in 684 PD. Rennin has been long-dead, or at least his body has. Before dying, Rennin took the time and resources to find a way to live beyond death, a failproof way. This is further described in [[Devil in the Machine]]
