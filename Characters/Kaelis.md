Kaelis used to be a devil of the Archdevil [[Amon]]'s infernal legion. After being won by [[Baato]], he has dedicated the past 78 years to 

Calculating, cruel, but hot-headed. Kaelis enjoys testing mortals’ limits and finding their true desires, but will lose his temper when got off guard with insults. His goal is to entice the party into agreeing to a temporary truce or non-violence pact while subtly provoking them, hoping to trip them into a poor deal.  

Kaelis is the main devil in charge of hunting [[Alorus]], and is fervent in doing so. At the beginning, he lost track of him, but he is quickly on their tails, suspecting that they had gone up North after checking [[Gristwell]]. Kaelis has a desperate and obsessed one-sided affection for [[Baato]], and a big reason he is chasing Alorus is because he is jealous of the attention that Alorus had. Kaelis also has a deep platonic love for [[Veyra]].

 Kaelis wields the magical artifact [[Elkoler, the Ever-Starving Flame]]. Elkoler is Awakened by Kaelis, but will enter an Exalted state if Kaelis kills Alorus.
