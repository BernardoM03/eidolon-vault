Calculating, cruel, but hot-headed. Kaelis enjoys testing mortals’ limits and finding their true desires, but will lose his temper when got off guard with insults. His goal is to entice the party into agreeing to a temporary truce or non-violence pact while subtly provoking them, hoping to trip them into a poor deal.  

Kaelis is the main devil in charge of hunting Alorus, and is fervent in doing so. At the beginning, he lost track of him, but he is quickly on their tails, suspecting that they had gone up North after checking Gristwell. Kaelis has a desperate and obsessed one-sided affection for Baato, and a big reason he is chasing Alorus is because he is jealous of the attention that Alorus had.

### Elkoler, the Ever-Starving Flame.
Elkoler is a powerful demon of fire trapped in a scimitar wielded by Kaelis. Elkoler hungers for blood and violence to satiate his desires, and offers Kaelis immense firepower in return. Elkoler is Awakened by Kaelis, but will enter an Exalted state if Kaelis kills Alorus.

Dormant: +1, a creature reduced to 0 hit points is reduced to ash and must make a DC 14 Charisma save or have their soul consumed. They can only be brought back via Wish.

Awakened: +2, each strike deals an additional 1d6 fire damage. The wielder bypasses 1 stage of resistance for all fire damage dealt. The DC is increased to DC 16

Exalted: + 3. The DC is increased to DC 18. Fire damage dealt by the wielder always takes the max roll.
