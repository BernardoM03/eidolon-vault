Andri, who sometimes refers to himself as "The Dwarven Hammer", is a dwarven ghost who "haunts" [[Brennly's Home]] within the [[Lantern Ward]] of [[Catameria]]. Andri died without knowing how, and that haunts him. His sense of unending curiosity and intrigue have fueled his soul to live beyond his mortality, as he has found himself trapped in the place of his murder until he can find out how.

In the meantime, he has become [[Brennly Wriggle]]'s unexpected roommate, living with him in this house for a few years at this point.
