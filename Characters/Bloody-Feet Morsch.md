Bloody-Feet Morsch, also known as just "The Bloody-Foot," is an ascended has due to the small power he receives from a pack of rats that follow him. It is a sacred ascension ceremony he ran into a long time ago, and his ascension caused him to gain a following of a few hundred rats. He is immortal and has a few powers that come along with it. In addition, the rats gain small sentience due to their worship of him.

Bloody-Feet Morsch was exiled from Cofgod 75 years before the events of the current campaign. He was once a shoe-maker for the village. One day, a kind man came to the village and offered to buy a pair of shoes for himself and his son, bringing along some materials that he wished for Morsch to use. What Morsch did not even consider was the man's foul intention, there was blood among the dye the man provided. Primal urges coursed through Morsch, for a drop was no longer enough. He needed his hat soaked in the warm and sweet embrace of blood and more blood. Morsch killed 3 that night, his custom-cobbled shoes soaking in the same blood as his cap. Folk tales claim of Bloody-Feet Morsch comes to travelers that appear in Sage's Hollow, praising and revering the man who brought his bloody rebirth.
