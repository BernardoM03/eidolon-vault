Baato is a Rakshasa, a fiend of intellect and patience, and like most devils, he is cunning and ambitious. His ambitions led him so far, he cheated the Archdevil [[Amon]] out of 108 soldiers and now must repay that debt with 108 innocent souls before he can reclaim his former power.

His expulsion from the 9 Hells thrust him into the Material plane, deep in the center of a small hamlet outside the region of [[Catameria]]. Thus, he created the character of [[The Sage]]. Acting as the religious savior of this hamlet, he provided purpose, salvation, and parts of his weakened powers. This was to fulfill a ritual to store the lives of the innocent souls of his new hamlet [[Sage's Hollow]], store them into a vessel before creating soul coins and fulfilling his bargain with Amon to break his curse. To Baato, that ritual is already won as he awaits his final tally on his ledge. 

For the past 10 years, his attention has turned north to the city of Catameria, where civilization gives him the social networks, institutions, and ambitious mortals he prefers to manipulate

## Baeldric Vauldra
Origin: Tiefling (To obscure any thought of the man being an actual Devil)
Age: 65 (remember this because this is how long ago he first stepped inside Catameria)
Demeanor: Weathered, warm like a smoldering fire, amused, unfailingly gracious.

The character Baeldric Vauldra is Baato’s persona of a high-society noble in Catameria. He lives in a manor at the northernmost end of the Verdure District, where the cliffs of the city overlook the region.

Baeldric Vauldra presents as a distinguished Tiefling with muted infernal traits. His skin is a deep crimson faded with age into a dark, wine-soaked tone. His horns are short and curved, polished smooth, almost ceremonial. Salt and pepper hair silvered at the temples, tied back neatly behind his ears. 

He dresses in curated comfort. Well-fitted long coat over layered robes with soft leather boots kept immaculately. Colors in the range of charcoal, brass, and deep blue

## Infernal Legion
[[Kaelis]], a hot-headed lieutenant in charge of hunting Alorus
[[Veyra]], cold and detached right-hand of Kaelis
## Alorus

Baato has already gotten his use out of Alorus, using his innate font of magic to pose as the Sage and take the 108 souls for himself. He no longer has any use for Alorus as he sees fit, but given the chance for an easy capture, he won’t decline it. He sent a message to Alorus via Sending, claiming that he would find him and the others that captured him, but this was a ploy to stop anyone from revealing the ritual in Sage’s Hollow. He was too far in and much too close to let his plans be ruined.
