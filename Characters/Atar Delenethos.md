Atar is a middle aged male. Atar is a Firewright, a dedicated member of a religious order known as the Scholars of the Eternal Flame, who worship [[Sol'aar, the Eternal Flame]]. He currently works under the Temple of the Eternal Flame in the city of Catameria ([[Scholar's of the Eternal Flame (Catameria)]]).

Atar has a close working relationship with [[Brennly Wriggle]], an older scholarly adventurer who lives in Catameria. Through Brennly, Atar came to know an unordinary construct known as [[Cogsworth]], before heading down to a small village south of Catameria's borders known as [[Sage's Hollow]].

Atar is going through a crisis of faith of sorts. He has devoted years of his life to the pursuit of knowledge, philosophy, and history, but finds his lack of enlightenment to weigh down upon him.
