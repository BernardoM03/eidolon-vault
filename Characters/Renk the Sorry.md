Renk is an devil in servitude to [[Rennin III Meredane]], ordered by [[Rennin Meredane]]. 

Renk is unwaveringly loyal to the young master in a completely unhinged and delusional way. Renk is beaten, abused, and tortured by Rennin III in private, and these come across as scars and bruises across his body, but he still deeply loves the young man.

Serving and being around his master is enough to fulfill Renk, and sometimes that leads Renk to question why Rennin doesn't feel the same towards him. This can lead to jealously, hatred, and characteristically brutal violence to those that Rennin pays attention to.

Renk uses a modified version of the Oni statblock in the MM'25. Heavily considering creating a "Phase 2" statblock for Renk, as he is such a fun and interesting character to play within combat.
