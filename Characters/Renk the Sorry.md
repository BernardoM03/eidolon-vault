Renk is an devil in servitude to [[Rennin III Meredane]], ordered by [[Rennin Meredane]]. Renk is unwaveringly loyal to the young master in a completely unhinged and delusional way. 

Renk is beaten, abused, and tortured by Rennin III in private, and these come across as scars and bruises across his body. Renk uses the Oni stat block in the MM'25.
