A supernatural third essence that exists beside Matter and Energy. Magic in its raw state is diffuse, but when manipulated can be used for a variety of supernatural purposes, including creating and embodying souls, developing into spirits, and the varied applications of spell craft and alchemy.

## Spellcasting
Spellcasting is the art of shaping this essence. Arcane casters study the nature of Magic itself to manipulate it through technique. Spiritual casters rely on conduits and agreements that grant them access through the influence of powerful spirits.

### Arcane Magic
Arcane Magic deals with the direct manipulation of the essence commonly known as "Magic." Artificers, Bards, Wizards, and Arcane Sorcerers (and other relevant subclasses) can innately manipulate magic without the contract with a more powerful spirit. Powerful Spirits of all kinds have a strong connection to Magic, allowing themselves to manipulate Magic in an Arcane way. 

### Spiritual Magic
Spiritual Magic is magic passed down by powerful [[Natural Spirit]] or [[Sentient Spirit]]. Some form of connection to a Spirit-- such as a pact, worship, or servitude-- allows an individual to access this spell power. Clerics, Druids, Rangers, Paladins, and Warlocks all utilize spiritual connections to utilize Spiritual Magic
