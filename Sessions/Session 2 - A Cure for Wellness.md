One location will be the Mushroom Lake Village, [[Cofgod]]. This will be a relatively small and chill village. This village will consist of some smaller personalities within the campaign, with its residents being the blue caps. These faerie-adjacent creatures are a peaceful variant of red-caps, dyeing their hats with a specific blue dye gathered from type of mushroom. This mushroom is partially hallucinogenic, which causes them to be quite chill/drug induced hippies at points. Red caps are generally blood-lusted when their caps are dyed with blood, so exposing these creatures to blood is tantamount to a violent and bloody death. Some villagers have been exposed to even drops of blood on their cap, and are exiled from the village for safety of the mass. Some exiled red caps may even be in the greater Hollow as lingering creatures, such as Bloody-Feet Morsch, a small deity.

## A Talk With The Bloody-Foot
[[Bloody-Feet Morsch]] will approach the party during the first night of the campaign. He will only talk to the members of the party that came from outside of [[Sage's Hollow]], and will threaten the party's patron if they let slip about his existence or intentions. He wants the party to learn more about what is inside the Sage's Statue and the importance of the ceremonies they celebrate when a death occurs. "The smell of death always attracts me to watch, but too many eyes linger on the ceremony. A peculiar festival, as I'm sure you saw today. I want to know more, so you will find out for the great Bloody-Foot himself."

I want Morsch here to be a morally grey acquaintance to the party. Their morals might not align, but their interests do. Morsch wants to know more about the Sage and the theocracy of the village. His interest lies in the ceremony of death, and one that he smells coming. "The smell of death always attracts me to watch upon this hamlet, and I smell it thick tonight. Yet, too many eyes linger amongst the eldest and youngest, so you will find out for the Bloody-Foot yourselves." Morsch will threaten the party abstractly, but mention Mr. Wriggle and Adelaide's parents as being under his watch as well. "Best not tussle with a faerie's tricks oh dull ones," he will say.

1. `Now, ye heapin hunk of fae-bane, release my wee friend there. He’s a valuable soul, that one." *he pauses, pointing at the rat in cogworth's hand with his long, sharp finger.`
2. `This peculiar scent always draws me to this quiet hole, and what follows is always death. And it’s thick tonight.`
3. `I want to know what that scent might be. It be emanating from the giant pile o' stones down there, but too many eyes watch. The elders and the young. So ye’ll find out for the Bloody-Foot yourselves`
4. 1. `Best not tussle with a faerie’s tricks, oh dull ones. I could make your dreams as tiring as the day...   (if the party still says no) Or perhaps, I could make your ol' halfling or the nice ol' lass in this house feel it for yee.`
5. `The Bloody-Foot whispers into his hand, and a sudden voice appears in Cogsworth and Atar's head. "Aye, ye look like yer souls have a bit o' grit, which is more than I can say for these sheep-folk. Yer stuck here, eh? And yer wee master's wasting away? S' not a coincidence ye know. I KNOW things that you don't about this hole"`

The party will likely want to travel to Cofgod come morning, so the journey will have some fun encounters showing some of the weird quirks of the forest. I want there to be substantial fey-weirdness the closer to Cofgod there is, as a portal to the Feywild exists there. In addition, I want there to be small oddities surrounding the village that could be indicative of strange reality-bending magic, such as a two headed toad, the unblinking fisher man etc...

## Encounter 1: The Two-Headed Frog
A creature hops across the path: a healthy, bright green toad with two perfectly formed heads, each blinking independently. It makes a normal, single croak.

## Encounter 2: The Unblinking Fisherman
 An elderly villager, Hargrove, is sitting on a stump a bit upstream from the village, simply staring into the river. He holds a simply crafted fishing rod in his hands. He is not threatening, just completely still, and he does not blink. If questioned, Hargrove has no memory of how long he’s been there, only that he’s waiting for the "perfect moment to reel that sucker in."
 
## Encounter 3: A Battle with the Manticore
The party comes across a manticore eager for battle. In order to pass, the party must fight the manticore. Upon victory, the manticore will either offer it's life or its service, hinting at it's sibling further south in the coast.
