The group entered the city of [[Catameria]], finally settling down at [[Brennly's Home]] in the [[Lantern Ward]]. They unpacked, meeting with Andri and exploring the house itself to find individual places to sleep and get ready for their stay for a while. To research a bit more about Alorus himself, Atar elected the party to go study at the Temple for the [[Scholar's of the Eternal Flame (Catameria)]], which was nearby in the Lantern Ward

Atar found lots of information about Alorus's magic, and his identity not just as an Aasimar, but much more celestial and they originally assumed. Your magic also allowed you to understand that Alorus's magic is innate, not bestowed, and acts as a font of magic for Adelaide, a sorcerer (who originally believed her magic to be a gift from Sage). The clues are lined up and answers have been found. The devil who chained Alorus up used him as a font of magic for their own purposes, one of those being tied to the Sage's Cairn, for what purpose you do not know. In the meantime, Alorus wishes to practice his magic, defend himself, and get answers for himself, you all, and mainly the confused girl who can seem to only wave a rolling pin for answers.

Twila ended up teaching Adelaide how to read. Cogsworth went to get books for Alorus and Adelaide for their prospective studies, and also to pick up some food at Donald O'Micks, a low-quality sandwich shop in the city. On the way, he found another poster for the Winter Trials, as well as a poster for a serial kidnapping, the [[Case of the Sewer Snatcher]]. The victim was someone they recently came into contact with at [[Gatebridge]], a Sgt Artos Lemm. Immediately, the party went searching for answers, one location being posted at the bottom of the poster, the address of Artos and his father, Brent. The party ended off resolving themselves to find Artos, and to save him themselves.

Lots of rats mean there is lots of food for the rats to sustain themselves
