## Raven’s Summon
The night has begun. You just made your way North, only to find your path blocked by a dozen fiendish/tiefling like individuals searching for your newest companion. Not wanting to risk the encounter, you started making your way south. Discussion and strategy come to a halt, as we begin this session with the silence of the night being broken by a cacophony of ravens. The rustling of their wings beat into the leaves, and the caws surround you. They begin to land upon the trees above you, their bright warm yellow gaze madly peering into yours.  One raven emerges from the shadows, dropping a stone onto the ground before them.  

The party can identify this stone as a Sending Stone. This one is linked to the Grand Matron of Gristwell, Hestia Grinwald. She opens with the line “Are you those idiots that angered that devil?”

This begins a conversation between the party and Hestia. 
	“You are heading the wrong direction if you think just going north is safer. Those fiends are organized enough to keep a blockade upon the pathway.” You hear the faint rattle of trinkets on her clothing as she shifts the stone on her end.
	“If you want to avoid dying in a ditch, come to Gristwell. I will not chase you down, so decide quickly. The road south is misted tonight. Keep to the path and watch the tree line. My ravens will follow.”
	“You may sleep under a real roof for one night. That much I can offer.”
## Hestia Grinwald
Description: Elderly, with flour-white hair and cataract-clouded eyes. Her skin and hands are covered in tattoos that swirl down to her fingers. Runes and trinkets dot her clothes.

Tone: Not benevolent exactly, but pragmatic. She does see the very real possibility of death that surrounds each of the villagers and will aid them out of pity. Without her help, the party will likely aimlessly move through the spirited lands.

Function: Serves as the last source of true wisdom before the lands beyond. Because of her pity, she will serve as a sort of grounding reality for each adventurer. They might not realize the real danger that they are in, but Matron Grinwald will be blunt about it. In doing so, she will also reiterate that they will need a goal, something to strive for as they fight for their lives. With this goal, this true ambition, she will provide the location of either a spell, artifact, or person who can help the party member with their goal.
## The Town of Gristwell
The path south winds through sloping marsh and tired farmland, until the road finally gives out at a sagging wooden sign etched with the word Gristwell. The letters look recently re-carved, as though the town insists on reminding travelers that it still exists.

Houses lean close together near the bend of the River Skeld, roofs thick with moss and the lingering ash of old harvest fires. A few townsfolk watch from thresholds, their silhouettes still, as if waiting to see whether you are passing through or becoming a problem they will need to remember.

The river is louder here, slow and heavy but persistent, carrying with it the scent of old grain and wet stone. A crooked bridge spans it, marked with strings of faded charms. Ash bundles, river reeds tied in knots, and various other trinkets.

One older man stands at the edge of the town. Adelaide and Lucky, you know this man’s face. He is Merrin Holt, one of the few travelers who make it down this far into the valley. He seems to be packing up his last unsold/traded goods, preparing a journey back up north. The party can do some last minute trading with this man. 

There are no wheel-ruts south of Gristwell, as none of civilization steps beyond here. There are only trampled weeds and dark earth where nature begins reclaiming the road. The mist moves differently on this side of the river. It curls around your boots like fingers testing for warmth.

Matron Grinwald’s ravens appear again, perched along rooftops and signposts. Their warm yellow eyes track you as you enter, not hostile, but measuring. The majority stand upon the larger building connected to a water mill.
## The Matron’s Only Pity
Hestia Grinwald lives in what was once a granary. The building lists slightly, its stone foundation cracked under decades of water and frost. Inside, the walls are painted with layers of soot and spiraling runes, the ceiling strung with herbs that have dried into brittle curls. The air smells faintly of burnt sage and lit candles.

When the party enters her home, Hestia  greets them without ceremony. She stands crooked over her cane, her hair an ashy white and a pale cataract in the center of her eyes. Tattoos swirl from within her sleeves down to her fingers and runes and trinkets dot her clothes. “You survived the night. Good. I suppose that means you can listen.”

Insight DC 15: Despite a tough exterior, this is still a woman who has dealt with her fair share of loss. Her demeanor illustrates pity and protection, doing what little she can to protect these people that does not interfere with their duties. 

She motions you in with a flick of her fingers towards a small lounge surrounding a hearth, already turning her back to you. The herbs above her shift in the draft, their dried leaves whispering like distant voices. There are a multitude of well-taken care of chairs and couches, with a low-down table containing various breads and jams. 

“Sit. Eat if you must. Then speak plainly.”

## Merrin Holt
Description: A quiet, thin man with a nose reddened from cold and pipe smoke. He has short hair on a receding hairline covered by a beaten ushanka. He wears layers of mismatched wool, patched many times over. His cart contains odds and ends from the north: tanned hides, smoked fish, brass tools, rough pottery, lamp oil, and the occasional luxury like candied ginger. His mule, Bramble, is patient but clearly ready to leave

Tone: Cautious but not unfriendly. He is eager to beat the midday winds and start the climb back north, though he’ll humor the party for a few minutes if they want to trade.

Knowledge: Strange movements on the northern road: caravans traveling armed, hushed conversations in the inns. Rumours say certain militia has taken
## Ash Readings
Adelaide: Tiger: “Freedom is tested where cliffs rise against the northern wind. A Man Cloaked in Stripes watches from a manor window, refusing to bow. Within his study rests the answers you seek, waiting for one bold enough to claim it."

Twila: Sleeping Dragon: Power sleeps atop the highest ridges, in chambers stacked like books. The Overseer of Stone, whose eyes pierce through every corner, every past and every future. There, you may find catharsis.

Atar: Phoenix: Impatience smolders your inner flame. But the ash shows me this: Look for the birth of the first spark. Sit at its center, and find your truth in the flames.

Lucky: Mice: Return to some place familiar. Perhaps your curse will break if you confront what you've been running from.

Cogsworth: Sparrow: In the market streets where goods flow like water, a merchant trades charms for escape. Beneath crates stamped with winged fish, you will find your relic.
## The Forest Path
The party will have chosen to take the “Forest Path,” instead of the “Caravan Path.” This path allows the party more agency and decisions, as this will effectively be an open forest where the party can explore any landmarks and paths they wish with the safety of knowing that the fiends looking for Alorus will not be able to find them.
## Big & Back’s Cave
Navigating through this cave tunnel, the party will hear the humming of a large creature up ahead.

Two Ogres, one Big and the other Back, are sitting around a fire with a very large cast iron pot. The smell wafting from the pot is incredibly rich and strong. The two Ogres are arguing about something, and observing them for a while, the party will find out it is about what else they need to add to the stew. 

Big, holds up a large vial, urging Back that they should pour this item in. Upon a DC 15 Arcana check, the party can tell this is Potion of Superior Healing.  Back, holds up a leather bag, proclaiming something about “beans.” The party can reasonably assume this is a Bag of Beans.

This situation can lead the party to Steal, Fight, or Negotiate:
- A character can attempt to steal the item(s) while the Ogres are arguing. The first item will be a DC 15 to steal successfully. The second item will be a DC 20 to steal successfully. If caught, combat automatically starts
- The party could convince the ogres that the item is a necessary “secret ingredient” for their stew or a magical charm. Charisma checks could manipulate them (Persuasion DC 15, Deception DC 15) for the first item, and (Persuasion DC 20, Deception DC 20) for both. An unsuccessful charisma check can lead to combat or the end of the encounter, as per DM decision.
