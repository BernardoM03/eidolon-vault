## Emerging from the Cave
With about 5-10 minutes more of walking, the party will find themselves at a light at the end of the tunnel. The cave opening brings them out to the coast, presenting the ocean’s marine layer encroaching upon the sandy-beach and forest. In the distance, a lighthouse peers from beyond the fog. If the players wish, they may stop by a few places of note. If they do not stop at the places of note, make them roll on a Forest encounter table relevant for their level.

## South Point Lighthouse
Walking through the path here, the party discovers a corpse laid upon the beach. It seems to be mostly looted, but the party can investigate a few pieces of note from the body.

Investigation Checks
DC 10: The body is an older sailor. Multiple piercing wounds line the back. The face resembles an aged keeper, similar to Willem Dafoe in The Lighthouse.
DC 15: A crushed note sits hidden under the jacket, crumpled as if balled into a fist. It reads:
“Southpoint Lighthouse has been taken over. I arrived for my shift and found the light unprepared. The doors were open. Protocol was broken. I do not know what happened to the keeper before me. The closer I get, the more I hea…” The note stops abruptly.
DC 18: Tracks around the body show the man was running and fell here. The stride and claw marks in the ground suggest panic in his last moments.

This lighthouse is currently occupied by a ship of Hadozee smugglers from overseas. These pirates are known as The Mad Monkeys, led by Captain Escanor de Simiano. The Mad Monkeys are here on their course to Catameria but have stopped here to plunder. Escanor has connections to Rennin III Meredane, and will cause a political stir in a few days' time if the players end up defeating these Mad Monkeys. 

Escanor Description: Roughly 4ft tall, dark-brown fur, beard braided into multiple twists. Captain’s hat tailor made for him. He holds a rifle that is a similar size to him. Brazilian accent, speaks Portuguese. Hidden on Escanor’s body is a letter sealed in a burnt yellow wax**


	The Letter
	Captain Escanor,
	
	Your last delivery reached its recipient without incident. The goods were of expected quality and quantity. 
	
	You are to continue along the planned course and make landfall when the lantern marker is lit. Do not approach the city proper before receiving confirmation from my agent on the water.
	
	There must be no disturbances in the district this week. Any conflict that brings attention to your presence will complicate matters for both of us. Conduct your affairs quickly and without spectacle.
	
	A new order will be prepared should the situation settle. Payment will follow the usual channels. 
	
	—R.R.R

Checks
DC 15 Investigation: This parchment and wax is of an unusually high quality
DC 20 Investigation: This burnt yellow wax is only used by House Meredane, but it is usually accompanied by the sigil of a “flying fish,” the house crest. 
DC 25 History: A player with ties to Catameria may try to discover who “R.R.R” could refer to, who is Rennin Meredane III. 

Ramparts: The ramparts were once orderly, but the pirates have left crates, rope, and a few open barrels sitting where they dropped them. These items look hastily placed rather than arranged with any intention. A few of the Hadozee shipmates are positioned here to keep watch. Their posture makes it clear they are not settled: they shift restlessly, glance toward the ocean often, and look ready to abandon the place if needed. One crate placed here contains equipment and plunder that the Hadozee brought aboard, and 

Store Room: Tables have been pushed aside. Oil containers lie open and their contents streak the floor in thin, hardened trails. A few maps and charts are spread haphazardly across a desk. Some reference coastal routes toward Catameria. A spyglass lies broken near the stairs, and several chairs have been knocked over, marking the hurried scuffle the keeper fled from. 

Bed Room: The living space beneath the main hall is cramped, with a low ceiling and walls lined with shelves. A DC 15 Perception/Investigation in this room will reveal a loose floorboard, one that has been pried up. The barely-alive lightkeeper has been hidden under here. He is dehydrated, weak, frightened, but alive. His wrists are bound with sailor’s knots. He can whisper, but strenuous talking hurts. He is cooperative once he trusts the players.

He knows the following info:
- The smugglers arrived during the night. He tried using the signal fire, but they spotted him before he reached it.
- He saw their captain giving hand signals toward a ship offshore that he could only partially see through the fog.
- He heard them argue that the lighthouse was not worth holding long; they planned to move on within two days.
- He heard them mention “the Catamerian contact” but does not know who that is
- If the party mentions the letter given the alias RRR, he would not know who it could stand for.
- He will offer the party 250 gold pieces in payment for the rescuing of the Lighthouse
