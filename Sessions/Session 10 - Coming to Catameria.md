### Brennly's Home
To go to the safest place that the party can rest at, Atar leads them to [[Brennly's Home]]. This house is located within a northern neighborhood of the [[Lantern Ward]], Goodbarrel Ave. A small section of homes here are designed for halflings/gnomes, which Brennly resides. As Atar knows, because he helped with the enchantments, the house is quite protective against divinations, and especially over the presence of fiends, elemental evils, and undead. This would be a good place for Alorus to stay while the rest of the party can explore the city.
