The party has just arrived into the City of [[Catameria]], the end goal of their days-long journey through the forest. For Alorus and Adelaide, the sheer scale this place was a wonder. For the others, it was a sorely missed sight. Going through [[Gatebridge]], they were properly checked for safe entry into the city, and made it to the city entrance of the [[Merion's Gate Commons]]. Lucky had the bullets to his gun taken away, but wasn't too mad because he was entranced by the fun nature of one Sgt Artos Lemm. Refer to [[Case of the Sewer Snatcher]] for more information on what happens to Artos Lemm later on. 
## Walking through Catameria
The grand province of [[Merion's Gate Commons]] is an amazing sight. With your path going up to the Lantern Ward, you get to avoid most of the foot traffic and carts that seem to be entering into the more populous parts of the city. 
### Foot Traffic to the City
Carts, wagons, and large shipments of goods are going into the south section of the city. Just below where you see the massive wall, you see the roofs of warehouses and towering cranes in [[Catavale South (Yards)]].

Workers on one section stand before the most gaudy section of the commons, a pathway that leads to the noisiest and brightest section of the city, [[The Promenade]]. Most of the tourists seem to be gravitating torwards there after seeing the sights of the Commons.

Heavy foot traffic goes on just above that, where plenty of citizens walk to and from, leading to the city center of [[Catavale North (Markets)]]
### Statues of Honor
At the north end of the Commons, there is a calmer garden-like area of the commons. This acre or two of land seems to be very well kept, with a small pathway circling a pond. Hundreds of life-size statues stand regally depicting the various leaders and cultural icons of the city every year. On the bases of each statue shows a name, a year, and an action. These are the Statues of Honor.

### Brennly's Home
To go to the safest place that the party can rest at, Atar leads them to [[Brennly's Home]]. This house is located within a northern neighborhood of the [[Lantern Ward]], Goodbarrel Ave. A small section of homes here are designed for halflings/gnomes, which Brennly resides. As Atar knows, because he helped with the enchantments, the house is quite protective against divinations, and especially over the presence of fiends, elemental evils, and undead. This would be a good place for Alorus to stay while the rest of the party can explore the city.
