Introduce the setting and some members of the party as they all arrive at the village of [[Sage's Hollow]]. The NPC Brennly Wriggle is ill and on a donkey drawn cart. One player is driving and the others are alongside walking or sitting, etc… The players come across the village to ask for a place to stay as the NPC recovers from illness. There are a few red flags that tip off suspicion to the party, but they don’t have another choice in the matter.

They are assigned to settle with Adelaide at the bakery by an old-looking Chosen of the village by the name of Chiryl, where the party will have as a base of operations. The downstream where the villagers collect water was contaminated by the "little men of Cofgod," so the normal settlements used to keep travelers are being used to house the sick. 

## BRENNLY WRIGGLE
- Appearance: An old halfling man (roughly 130 years old), reddened nose, messy combover with full head of white hair, chin curtain beard, preppy outfit with a vest and a large tool belt
- Roleplaying: Excited about any little talking point that others brings up, not very good at bringing up his own topics, reassures the party that they should follow their gut, grateful that they still care enough to look after him in his old age.
- Background: Wealthy background who fell out of his family ways due to a moral conflict, found his own people who fulfill his lifestyle, lived a long and moderately difficult life but he found peace. Has always dreaded going back home

Once the party is ready to sleep, [[Bloody-Feet Morsch]] will approach the party during the first night of the campaign.
