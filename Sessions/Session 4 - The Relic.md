## The Final Chamber
The smell is metallic and medicinal: old blood, incense, and alchemical rot. Tables and shelves line the perimeter, half-buried in fungal growth. Long-dried stains mark the stone floor beneath shackles embedded into the ground. A workbench of rusted implements: bone saws, scalpels, and curved hooks — alongside brushes, quills, and styluses carved from crystal.

Glass jars hold still-glowing fluids, each labelled in an elegant but alien script (Infernal written with mirrored letters). Vials of shimmering black and gold ink. A rack of hollow needles filled with the same ink. When Detect Magic is cast, they reveal a mixture of illusion and necromantic energy. This is a means to rewrite flesh and memory. Detect Magic reveals it opens something far away (a planar seal or vault).

## Freeing Him
Four chains bind different parts of his body. One binds around his left wrist and continues to his right; One circles his neck while another entraps his torso; The final chains his ankles together.

Each of the four chains binds a different aspect of his being Arcana / Religion checks:
DC 13: Recognize the runes are celestial in form but reversed — as if mirrored through infernal logic.
DC 16: Notice that the protections are one-way. They suppress surges outward, but they don’t resist outside influence.
DC 18: Realize that a precise magical pulse, or counterpoint of divine magic (such as Adelaide’s sorcery), could disrupt them.
A Dispel Magic (DC 15) or radiant damage near the chain’s rune causes it to shatter with a soundless crack, light spilling like molten gold. If any attempt is made to brute-force or dispel all four at once, a surge of energy rocks the cave (Dex save DC 14, 2d6 force damage). The magic must be unwound, not broken violently.

Given the party frees this bull-headed creature, he will be cold and naked upon the floor of this cave.

`The chains fall silent, their glow fading to nothing. The air is still except for this being's breathing: Slow, uneven, heavy in the chest. Steam rises faintly from his body as if the cold air is too sharp for him.  He doesn’t look at any of you right away. His shoulders tremble, possibly from weakness. Possibly from shock. The light in his eyes flickers, uncertain, like he’s learning how to see again. When he begins finally stands, it’s unsteady. He takes his first look up, as scans across each of you for but a moment before his voice quivers his first cracked words. "r-Robes.. do you have any spare?"` 

The party can share a small conversation with the bull-headed being before his eyes shutter into stillness. Widened, he stays unmoving for 5-10 seconds, as he hears a message from Baato

`I'm sorry. We are all in danger. He knows you freed me. I'm so sorry.  Sending: "I don't know how you were found, but I'll sniff you out again relic. Your saviors can join you next time as well.`"

## The Journey From Now
The party is now on the run. They must make a decision. Will they head back to the hamlet of [[Sage's Hollow]] or immediately head out on their way.

If the party wants to head back to Sage's Hollow for whatever reason, they cannot stay the night with their new member. The Chosen will convene and not allow it. If the party wants to give up on the bull-headed man for his own safety, he will remind them that they are ALL marked after. He will respect their decision, but it will mean their deaths.

The party will now make the decision of where they want to go. They can try to go North-West, to move torwards the exit of Sage's Hollow. If they attempt to go in that direction, they will come across many enemies. These are minions under Baato. The party should NOT be able to make it past all these enemies. I will consider this to be late-campaign level content, where the party should be roughly levels 7-8. As a party of 5 level 3s, they should be taken care of quite quickly if they are not careful.

The other option is to move south. Adelaide will know of a small village south by the River Skeld, Gristwell. Talk of this part of town is minimal among the villagers at Sage's Hollow as it is not safe for the villagers.

## Back to Sage's Hollow
As the party moves back to Sage's Hollow, they make their way at around 4pm. The sun begins to set around the end of the journey. Perhaps the party will make an encounter roll, but the chance of combat should be rare. They have gone through 2 combat encounters with only one short rest in between.

Once the party returns to the village, Chiryl will be waiting for them. They party from now on will be able to head to their own locations, but Chiryl will ask about their journey. In addition, when the conversation has concluded, he will ask about the bull-headed man. Once finished, he will go talk to the Chosen and see what will be done by the night. Chiryl will return and give the solemn news that the bull-headed man cannot stay with the village, even for just the night. If the party wants to give up on the bull-headed man for his own safety, he will remind them that they are ALL marked after. He will respect their decision, but it will mean their deaths.

If the party checks on Brennly Wriggle, he will strongly recommend that the party leave him behind for now. He would love the adventure, but he cannot go as he is too sick. He will be safe with the villagers. The party cannot stay the night, but they can take what equipment they wish, and depart.

The party can converse with [[Bloody-Feet Morsch]] again to update him on the information provided. He will provide information on Brennly Wriggle, stating that he is not the person that Atar and Cogsworth thought he was.
