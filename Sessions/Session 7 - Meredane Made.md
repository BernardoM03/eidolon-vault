## The Mad Monkey's Ship
After a long-rest at the South-Point Lighthouse, the party goes to explore the hidden ship of the Mad Monkey's, looking for the hidden shipment that they were smuggling into Catameria for the mysterious RRR. 

The ship is located about 1 mile up the northern coast, anchored in a small hidden ravine. Aboard the sloop is Captain Escanor and his last remaining crewmate, Rafi. They are harmless now, thankful for having their lives spared, and they welcome the group aboard the ship to investigate what they like. 

In the cargo hold, about a dozen large crates are boarded up with the symbol of a flying fish, the crest of one of the most notable houses, House Meredane. Inside these crates are parts for humanoid metal constructs, in the same make as Cogsworth.

## Moss-Back Boar
As the players emerge back into the forest, they notice deep furrows gouged into the ground, tracks of a large beast. Further investigation shows mats of fur and moss snagged on branches. Progressing further down this path brings the party into the inevitable encounter with this creature.

The boar is enormous. Its shoulders exceed the chest of a grown human. It moves with the heavy, deliberate confidence of something that has never lost a fight. Thick mats of tangled fur hold deep moss, pale lichens, and patches of bark like plates. Thin, rootlike tendrils thread through the fur, gripping itself around the creature.

The Mossback Boar is territorial rather than murderous. It warns first. Low grunts that vibrate through the ground. Stomping and scraping its tusks against trees. By avoiding the creature’s territory, the party will add another 4-8 hours to their journey, depending on speed, enough to cause a check of exhaustion. 

Checks:
DC < 10 Animal Handling: You upset the beast, and it begins to charge
DC 12 Animal Handling: You do not upset the creature, but perhaps the boar is able to be calmed, if you can show it the proper respect to appease it. It is very territorial of its land, likely protecting something
DC 15 Animal handling: You are able to calm the beast. It chuffs, seeming like it wishes to lead you.
## Elven Traveler
The fog thins enough to show a faint orange glow flickering ahead. In a clearing further ahead, there sits a lone elf beside a modest campfire. His clothes look old but well-kept. His pack is thin and practical. A small steel kettle hangs above the flame, releasing the scent of strong herbs. He raises his eyes as the party approaches,  gestures to the fire saying  they are welcome to share warmth. He offers food that is plain but nourishing: root mash, dried nuts, a mild broth, asking nothing in return. If asked, he introduces himself as Taleris, but does not elaborate until asked.

Taleris is here because he is traveling the natural world. He quite enjoys the forests here, though he was a bit solemn when he passed the farmlands of Catameria.

After the party has set up their bedrolls and camp supplies, Taleris offers a vision of the future for the group if they wish. It can be individual, or for the group as a whole.

The party requested to know whether it would be in their best interest to notify the city guard about the constructs being smuggled by Captain Escanor and the Mad Monkeys. Taleris had stated that this course of action would be like a strong river, a heavy path that could seek to hinder your own personal agency.

Knowledge he can impart:
- “If the main road is where you seek, you are very close. About a few miles in that direction” as he points further North-West. 
- He knows that the sky will clear up a bit tomorrow morning, allowing for a bit of sunlight in the morning and afternoon. 
- “Your packs are heavy in different ways. You will walk easier and faster if you trade loads for a day.” This requires personal items to be swapped around, so the players will need to make the conscious decision to trust in each other, and in doing so, they get to skip one combat encounter.

The party will gain a long-rest easily here, but Taleris will leave quite early into dawn, before the sun even sets. As an elf, he only needs 4 hours of trance to get a long-rest. Once the party wakes up, Taleris will be gone. If a party member takes the 2nd watch of the night, they will see him pack and depart.
