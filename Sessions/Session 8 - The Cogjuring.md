## Check for Bloody-Foot
I forgot to do this roll earlier, but [[Bloody-Feet Morsch]] is hidden with the party currently. Have Adelaide roll two perception checks for each time she decided to rest. Any roll above a 16 will notice the Bloody-Foot's summoning rat within her backpack. The Bloody-Foot will then open a bloody portal, and appear amongst the party. He will thank them for "getting him out of that isolated and cold wasteland," and that he's off to a greater future. 

After a long rest at this forest clearing, the party is very close to Catameria, about 2.5 days away at this point. Once ready, they can continue on their journey northward.

## Crystal River
This is a simple encounter, the party just needs to cross the river here. It’s about a mile wide, and requires the party to swim. If everyone can swim, then this encounter is pretty easy. If not, this creates a fun roleplaying moment amongst the party about how they can cross the river.

## Nature’s First Strike
The party approaches the dead patch passing through the forest on this end of the river. No insects, no birds, no wind. A small clearing lies ahead, and it emanates a strong foul odor. At the center sits the pile of corpses. The victims vary in age and clothing: hunters, wanderers, farmers, one courier. No weapons remain.

Approaching will have a medium-sized humanoid figure jump and attack the party. 

From the shadows of the trees, a dark shadow jumps out at an intense pace. Your vision adapts to the speed, and a sting of betrayal flashes through your mind as you see Cogsworth begin his attack... before you notice that Cogsworth hasn't moved from where he's standing. This is a near identical robot, just like the ones you found on the Mad Monkey's ship.

The Harrower will flee before being killed, leaving the party at this site. The character who performs best in this fight gains the boon Lesser Nature's Vigor

 An investigation will allow the party to find information about the creature, and help them if they end up encountering it later on. 

Body Checks
Medicine DC 10: A few ribs are cracked inward as though something pressed into the chest with immense pressure.
Medicine DC 15: Many corpses show the same bruise pattern along the throat, arms, and torso: long, coiling marks like vines tightening inwards. The deaths were slow and planned. 
Medicine DC 20: A faint, sweet rot clings to their skin, like sap left too long in the sun. The skin of the corpses seem like they have rotted for days, but given the nature of the climate and the fact that someone like Taleris, a wood elf was nearby, that doesn’t seem accurate. Likely some necromantic-magic or a disease or some kind. 

Area Checks
Investigation DC 10: Certain trees bear deep gouges. They look like the marks of long talons or claws. Around 6ish feet onto the tree, there is a carved symbol, bleeding a dark tar-like sap.
Investigation DC 15: The symbol emanates primal magic, a type of necromancy.
Arcana DC 20: This combination of druidic and necrotic magic fits an ancient practice known as consumption. The natural spirit “hunts” and utilizes the life-force of its victims to grow in power. You would need to seek out a monster-hunter to know more.
Investigation DC 20: The markings show that the victims were tied to the tree, constricted slowly and crushed to death. The carved symbol is a ritual marking, a spell cast on each victim, likely imbuing them with this necromantic disease.

Tracks show the creature went further north, through the trees, a separate path from where you plan to head, but closer to your destination still.
