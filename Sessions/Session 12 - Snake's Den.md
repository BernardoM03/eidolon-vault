The party found themselves deep in the trail in the Case of the Sewer Snatcher. Attempting to track down and save Artos Lemm, they leave Molestreet and make their way towards the Northern Merial Docks. There, they look for a journalist that follows the case, Frankie Pierce of Dimming Press, a middle aged and stressed Drow man. After convincing them of their mutual work, and exchanging ideas on what has happened, Frankie helps the party by guiding them on their path to the Sewers. 

This begins a dungeon in the sewer system, as they explore and make their way through the unkept system and Gravel Rat territory. After sending a few young Dimming kids on their way, they move further in and find both a set of jail cells and a drug production lab. The party ends their stay talking to an eccentric prisoner known as Chaos, a slimey middle aged tiefling man who might have some information for them, but at the expense of freeing him.

### Chaos's Plea
A 191 y/o tiefling slaver with long braided hair, long nails, red skin, and dyed red hair. He is very talkative as the party passes by. If attacked, he responds with a 3rd level Hellish Rebuke (4d10 fire damage), laughing maniacally through his last moments.

Chaos has proposed a deal to the party, offering to tell them where Artos Lemm is in return for freeing him from his current imprisonment. Chaos is a subset of the unknown, and that means that he is tied to the Quiet Dark.
