[[The Winter Trials]]

As you venture down into the city proper, the sun's rays gently pierce through holes in the clouded winter sky. Today is the first day of the Winter Trials, a celebration of the city's culture of adventurers.

In the colosseum plaza, various parties stand on raised platforms while heralds announce names and sponsors. Banners of the Noble Houses ripple overhead. Most crowds gather around the platform of the Ivory Standard. They wear polished half-plate and white tabards, the most prominent being a young woman with olive skin and dark curly hair, bordering on the edge of childhood. With a single movement or word, the hearts of the crowd bends in her direction. A perfect combination of soldier and nobility, making for the perfect celebrity.

But that is not where you are concerned, as you have not registered yet. You easily find a line of the less prominent parties lined up, seemingly in the same boat as you. How do you take in this moment?

### Kaelis and Veyra
Adelaide, you feel a sinister chill in the font of your magic, almost like a 6th sense of danger. You feel something watching you. 
`DC 15 Perception Check: About 60 feet away, now at the beginning of the line, you see a pair of tieflings. For a fraction of a second, you meet eyes.`

Talon, you are also here on the morning of the Winter Trials. Why don't you introduce your character and what they are doing here this morning. 

You spot an odd group consisting of a Firewright of the Eternal Flame, a woman dressed like she's never stepped in a city before, a seemingly sentient automaton, and a black tabaxi.

### Renoux, the Loxodon
Jaspar, you see the ugly and familiar mug of a colleague approaching you. His white and black pinstripe suit does not fit the occasion at all, dressing more as a mobster closing a deal rather than citizen during a city celebration. On his hands, he has Ivory cuffs and rings on nearly every finger. His tusks are polished. His eyes are sharp, but tired. 

"Ah, Monsieur Delaware. I see you have aligned yourselves with the sewer heroes." He says, quickly turning to you all. "Quite the astonishing feat. I did not think anyone in this city stupid enough to stand up to Monsieur Ward. You have made the economy there... unstable. Your reputation will surely accrue interest, though perhaps not in your favor."

After this, respond accordingly, and end the conversation with the following

“Snake-Eyes has investors. You interrupted revenue streams. Watch the shadows in this arena. Some losses are engineered.”

## The Walk In
Unless their is something you would like to accomplish, I will move the scene forward. About an hour passes as the rest of the teams register in this pseudo opening ceremony for the Trials, but it is time to be introduced to the audience in the Stadium itself. A coordinator in front of the large gate of the colosseum speaks  up. "ALL GROUPS LINE UP IN GROUPS. STICK TO ONE ANOTHER SO THAT YOU DONT GET SEPARATED." The parties begin to shift and move to the gate in tandem. 
### The Laughing Gauntlet
Beside you, a party of men and women in colorful armor are loudly laughing. They seem to be already gambling on who survives the first round, with a surprising amount of information. As you catch the eye of one of the members, they shout over to you “Heard you cleared rats. Hope you’re good with monsters too!” They end up providing a bit of information to the party about other groups.

### Ivory Standard
You see this group before. Most definitely the fan favorite. While looking, you see the leader, Ilya Tesseron meet your eyes in analysis, holding your gaze for a fraction of a second. 
The Laughing Gauntlet states "favorites to win the competition. Heard they actually decided to  push this tournament back a week so princess over there could compete."
### Swamp Things
One group seems to be covered in cloaks of moss and bone charms. They whisper prayers over small vials of monster blood.
The Laughing Gauntlet states "They hunt what they fight. Sell parts to the alchemists in the upper city."
### Kaelis and Veyra
You settle back amongst yourselves as your group gets closer to the gates. Just before you head forward, the tiefling you saw before seems to be approaching you. The smell of sulfur fills the air as he gets closer, the contained rage beneath his fiery yellow eyes easily poking through. He wears a wonderfully crafted black half-plate, and an ornate sword emblazoned with an eye, currently closed. He stops about 4 feet away from you. "I have followed you for nearly two weeks, and I have finally found you. But it would be pointless to torture and kill you here. I will find that fucking cow and pry it from your hands, cold or not." He begins to walk away. He stops next to another tiefling in line for the tournament.
### Waiting Room
You are led beneath the colosseum through a descending corridor of pale stone. The roar of the crowd above becomes a low, constant tremor. "Your team will be marked on which room you can prepare yourself in. You will be alerted 5 minutes before you are to fight, so be prepared."

The room is spacious enough. Stone walls smoothed and reinforced on each side, with a wide bench running along the far wall. Weapon racks are fixed to one wall and two iron braziers burning a smokeless flame for warmth. Near the door, a stone disk is hung up, engraved with enchantment sigils. The air smells faintly of oil, leather, and old sweat.

### First Battle
The stone disk begins to hum. The sigils fill with pale blue light. Then a voice resonates directly from the stone: “Journeyman Division. Chamber Two. Five minutes to entry.”

For a heartbeat, nothing is there.  
Then two shapes. Then three. Then one.  
A low growl reverberates through the arena as a sleek, panther-like form flickers into solidity, tentacles whipping through the air.
