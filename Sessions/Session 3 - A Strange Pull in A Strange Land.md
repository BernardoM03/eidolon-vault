The party stands in the middle of an open clearing at the precipice of the forest and the mountains. This area of land is where a mighty Manticore rests after a hard-fought duel, where the party landed plenty of strong and well-made strikes. After this win, the party spared the Manticore and accepted the gift of his Guardian Whistle. One blow and the Manticore will appear when the party needs its knowledge and strength.

It is just past midday, and [[Cofgod]] rests about a 15 minute journey ahead. That is where they plan to reach next, and deal with the pacified Blue Caps of Cofgod. 

## Encounter 1: The Sticky Walkway
The path to Cofgod is a very simple walk without further complications, but the weirdness of fey magic begins to stand out. Among the green grass and leaves, patches of ultra-violet plants and prismarine glowing mushrooms pop out. Trees that have leaves fall down onto the ground have them float right back upward onto the branches.

Just before the clearing that holds the village, you notice a few small elderly men splayed out on the area. One man lies down against the trunk of a tree with his eyes dazing into the sky. Another has found a spot of sunlight and has laid face-up and is moving his arms and legs up and down like a snow angel. The final one is face down ass up in the path right in front of you. Additionally, you notice the cobblestone path is crossed by a narrow puddle of sticky blue sap that seeps in between some of the stones. Only a few spots remain dry, but they are few are far between. One jump seems impossible unless you use the man as a stepping stone.

Any player that wishes to pass through without dirtying their feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity check or gain disadvantage on stealth checks and halved movement speed until a short rest (They will need to SCRUB their shoes).

## The Village of Cofgod
The party arrives at the village of [[Cofgod]], and the party now has a chance to directly follow up on the quest given by Apprentice Chiryl.

Initial Question: If the party asks about contaminating the river water, the Blue Caps respond with pure confusion and gentle denial.

Blue Cap: "The water? Why would we... put our good sap in the messy water? We use the water for the mushrooms, friend. The water is clean. You say those dull ones in the valley blame us for their tummy-aches, but we just want to be quiet."

Confirmation: A simple DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check to check the river and the Blue Cap's lifestyle confirms their innocence. They wouldn't intentionally pollute the river because they rely on it for their magic mushrooms.

**Adelaide's draw to the Cave System**
As felt earlier in the session, Adelaide's internal font of magic wells up as she approaches these caves. They don't feel a pull, but they can judge which direction this feeling is stronger and follow that.

"You have never felt as close to your magic as you do now"

If Adelaide casts a spell "Even casting your spell as you normally do now, golden sparks fling out from where you channel. While casting still feels possible, you need to control this fluctuating surge."

## The Cave Mouth
At the edge of the village inward, a cave opens from a slit in the forested hillside. Glowing mycelium veins line the walls emitting small spores that drift like fireflies. The air smells fresh, even deeper within the cave.

Lichen hugs to the stone and glows in emanating pulses. On a DC 15 Arcana check, the party can discover lichen’s rhythmic glow subtly syncs with nearby heartbeats or emotional states.

A Detect Magic spell reveals faint transmutation and enchantment auras intertwined with the natural growth. In addition, some illusion and abjuration is placed upon the Mycelium veins. A successful perception check at DC 17 can locate a small arcane sigil underneath some moss. This sigil contains the same signature found at the Sage's Cairn.

## Faerie Dragon's Lair
The tunnel narrows, then opens into a cluster of various passages that weave around each other.

`Initial Effect: As soon as they enter, everyone makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14).  Fail: The light shifts disorientingly; the player momentarily believes their companions vanish or the path behind them has sealed. They experience a minute or two of rising panic.  Success: The PC feels unease but recognizes the disorientation as magical, not physical.`

Each wall pulses with soft, colorful light — blues, greens, and pinks shifting and blending as though painted by breath. The air hums faintly, and when you move, the light shifts again, making it difficult to keep track of which passage you came from.

`Survival / Insight (DC 15): Observing the tunnel walls carefully reveals that real passages have a consistent glow rhythm — like slow breathing. False ones flicker subtly or loop back.  Investigation (DC 13): Finding faint footprints of small reptilian claws (the faerie dragons) shows the route they favor — this leads toward the true exit deeper in the cave. This also revelas small spherical hollows in the walls filled with glowing moss and glassy dew. The dew reflects light in kaleidoscopic patterns. These serve as sleeping chambers and stash spots for the faerie dragons.  Detect Magic or Arcana (DC 14): Reveals layers of minor illusion and faerie fire traces intertwined with the fungi. This is not one spell but dozens of tiny overlapping glamers maintained by several dragons in concert.`

After some exploration, the players will notice patterns that point toward the true exit — a narrow passage of white light where the glow does not shift color. Approaching it causes faint giggling to echo through the chamber, the faerie dragons boo at the party's success

## Crystal Hoard
The cavern opens into a domed grotto, its ceiling veined with crystal light. Hundreds of soft glows — mushrooms, gemstones, glass shards, and droplets of condensed dew

`3 stoppered vials of iridescent fungal oil (usable as ink for 3 spell scrolls)  A small music box that plays on its own when opened (illusory fey lullaby)  A cracked monocle rimmed with silver that reveals faint auras when worn (acts as Identify pearl)  A pouch of rainbow dust (component for Color Spray spell or a one-time cast of it)  A handful of small quartz fragments that hum softly, usable to enchant custom magic items  Sword of Dazzling Lights, + 1 shortsword (7 charges, casts Dancing Lights or Color Spray)  Shimmerleaf Cloak: once per day grants Mirror Image for 1 minute  Tiny crystal figurine of a faerie dragon with blue-green shimmer — detectable faint enchantment. Investigation (DC 15) reveals it hums with a “heartbeat” when the guardian awakens.`

The mound stirs — a deep rumble shaking loose pebbles and dust. What you took for a pile of crystal and moss shifts and rises, unfurling limbs as thick as oak trunks. Shards of rose quartz and smoky crystal jut from its shell, glowing faintly from within. A heavy head lifts, eyes gleaming with molten gold, and a hiss echoes like glass scraping glass.

## A Resting Place
The air here feels lighter and clearer, carrying the scent of moss and rain. A pool lies at the center, its surface as still as glass, glowing softly from beneath with the pale light of luminous fungi. Within the water, you see many bodies of Blue-Caps, completely still and completely in tact, as if they are sleeping beneath the surface of the water (They are dead). This room gives you a calm respite from the wildness of the rest of the cave, and a sense that you are visiting a very sacred but forgotten place. 

The chamber’s magic stabilizes the body and mind.  The party may take a short rest here. Each creature regains +1 additional hit point per Hit Die spent due to the restorative air. Characters who spend at least 10 minutes in silent reflection here make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw; on a success, they feel emotionally steadied, gaining advantage on their next saving throw against fear or charm before their next long rest. However, if any creature disturbs the bodies in the pool, the calm immediately fades: The glowing water dulls to grey, and the air becomes thick with spores.

## The Tortured
The air is heavy here, wet and luminous. As it has been the for the whole cave, the walls are alive with glowing veins of mycelium, their light pulsing towards something further into the cave. Now it pulses to the center of the chamber — toward it.

A figure hangs in a tangle of chains upon the wall. At first believe it to be a statue, bronze skin, flawless and still, until you see the slow and strained movement of breathing. The head is that of a bull, and the creature's eyes open for only a split second, pale, gold, the light of the mycelium pulsing the same gold.

Adelaide, you know without a doubt that this being, whatever it is, it has the same feeling at the magic you've known all your life. And it is chained here...
