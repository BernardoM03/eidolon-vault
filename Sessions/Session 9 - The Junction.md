## Maere, the Junction Town
Emerging from the forest, you enter an open grassland, plenty of flowers, tall grass, and sparse trees providing shade. The sunny weather and lack of clouds look beautiful in this area, and gives you the perfect view of a small Thorp about 1-2 miles ahead. This is [[Maere, Junction Town]], a small junction town mainly known as an adventurer/trader hub as they move further south.

The party can stop by The Stonewatch Outpost, the Bending Willow Inn, or the Gristle & Grain General Store.

Twila, you feel some form of unease as you step into the town. What do you think that could be?

## At the Bending Willow
This inn is a two-story half-timbered building, with a thatched roof and unusually high ceilings. Accommodations consist of several small rooms with wooden cots. The inn is widely known for its adventuring patrons. The innkeeper is an old male dwarf named Fari. He has an identical twin named Bari, who works opposite shifts.

Outside the inn, strapped against the horse’s left flank is the massive, triple-faced head of a chimera. The trophy is bound tight with leather straps, and the neck stump is packed with herbs to keep insects off.

The common room is long and warm. Exposed beams run high overhead, giving the space an airy hall-like feel unusual for an inn. The tables throughout the room are mismatched but sturdy pieces, seemingly collected over decades. The air smells of stewed vegetables, pine smoke, and ale. Posters on the walls advertise “Glory, Patronage, and an invitation to the Stone Crown: The Winter Trials”

### Call for Urgency
Madam Grinwald will contact the party here when they rest (44 on fate roll): She is contacting the party to warn them about the fiends on their tail. One hot-tempered devil came to inspect Gristwell in the morning, just before this message, and was able to find no trace going South. They suspect you are heading to the city.

When Adelaide first talks to an NPC, the quick and brunt nature of the accent catches you off guard. While not commonly spoken by the other villagers, it's similar to how your dad speaks.

**Patrons**:
Just a little goblin guy
	 Maybe he just wants a funny lil joke, idk, could be from anyone. Just a funny silly little joke of sorts, you know?

Talia Radfen, courier: Human, woman, early 20s, red-hair, freckles
	Talia’s boots are caked in dust and she keeps glancing at the door. Her satchel bears the royal seal of Catameria. She refuses to say whom her delivery is for, unless the party can convince her to drink, to which she will blurt it out accidentally. The delivery is for “the Grand Seneschal.”

Habrik “Twenty-Fingers” Dorn, degenerate. Human, man, late 30s, slicked back black hair
	Still only has ten fingers and laughs every time someone asks. He runs small gambling circles in the evenings, invites anyone who wants in. Habrik has 200 gold and he can be goaded into gambling today. His game of preference is [Gambit of Ord](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Gambit_of_Ord)

Mercedes Andifort III, veteran monster hunter Half-Elf, woman, mid 70s, lean and sharp-featured, with graying black hair tied back in a low braid. Her traveling leathers are worn but expertly maintained.
	She is seasoned, quiet, and observant. She watches the room without moving her head. When she smiles, it is small and sincere. She speaks sparingly and only after she has fully weighed her words. Tonight, she finally looks at ease. Boots off, feet up, a slow drink in hand: she is clearly enjoying a rare moment of rest. Mercedes is “between contracts.” This means she just killed a strong beast, and is letting her hands stop shaking before taking another job. She is addicted to this job though.
	The party can talk to Mercedes about the creature they saw earlier. When the party brings up the clearing, Mercedes listens without interrupting.
		- “Sounds like you found yourself a harrower.”
		- “It's a spirit, similar to a revenant. Born when something ancient and innocent has been wounded or corrupted, taking over its body for revenge. It feeds on those it seeks revenge towards. If what you said is true, and the victims did not have a common trait, this will be worse than I thought. I had hoped my next hunt would wait. Seems it will not.” Mercedes will leave come morning to investigate, and can meet the party again in the future. 
    
**Rumors**:
- Some say [[Queen Althaea]] is worse than the palace admits. Some say that the [[Prince Consort]] is keeping her poisoned. Some whisper Valcaryn mages are trying experimental arcane study to cure it and Tesseron wants it stopped.
- Traffic at the gate of [[Catameria]] is beginning to pick up due to the Winter Trials, lots of adventurers are making their way up to the City for the festivity. Locals gossip that House Tesseron is sending their prodigy, Ilya Tesseron, to compete for the first time.
- Merchants speak of adventuring groups from far regions arriving early to secure lodging, so finding an inn to stay at might be some trouble.

Leaving Maere behind, you  travel the well-worn main road that winds south toward the coast. Farmland rolls out in slow waves, broken by orchards, low stone fences, and the occasional watch-post. The road is busy this time of year: caravans heading toward Catameria’s markets, pilgrims walking in small clusters, and ox-drawn wagons stacked high with late-season goods. With the long march ahead, the pace naturally slows enough for conversation. Alorus glances toward the city’s distant silhouette and then back to the party.  “Before we reach the gate… do we have a plan for what happens once we’re inside?”

## Gates of Catameria

The conversation quiets as the road crests a final rise. [[Catameria]] unfurls across the coastline below, its scale impossible to ignore. The outer wall dominates the horizon, a sweeping line of pale stone reinforced by towers and bristling watch-crests. At its closest south-eastern edge stands [[Gatebridge]], narrow and fortified, already crowded with caravans and banners snapping in the wind.

Beyond the wall, the city climbs in staggered terraces: the line of massive ships on the coast of the [[Merial Docks]], and the cliffside estates of the [[Verdure District]] perched above on the north. Rising highest of all is the [[Stone Crown]], the monarch’s castle, catching sunlight with its pale towers and regal arches. It is a view meant to impress, and it succeeds.

You approach the fortified span of Gatebridge, where hundreds shuffle forward in tight, controlled lines. Bells chime overhead. Scribes sit at desks within stone towers serving at checking booths. Small arcane sigils flare above each booth as people pass through, alerting the next in line to move forward. Members of the [[Stone Guard]], the military protection of the city, shift in heavy armor at various points of this area. The entire place feels like a cross between a customs checkpoint and a ceremonial entry hall. You have a bit of time to look around and talk.

You hear a conductor call out instructions: “Have your names, origins, and documentation at the ready. Magical items must be presented openly. No illusions. No concealed enchantments.”

Once it is the party’s turn, they arrive at the Gate sanctioned currently by Sergeant Artos Lemm. He is much too friendly for a border guard; treats inspection like a tavern conversation. He is paid off by the Fang. Here are a few conversation quotes
- “Hello! My name is Sergeant Artos Lemm. How are you doing today?”
- “I will need your name, origin, and purpose of entry please!”
- “Welcome to Catameria! Love the blade. You sharpen that yourself?”
- “No way, my cousin is also a ___”
- “If you need a place to stay, you HAVE to check out The Old Sluice. Perfect for capable adventurers such as yourself”
