A Tiefling is a sub-type of [[Human]]. They share nearly all human features, but they commonly have a slew of devil-like features. This includes horns, tails, sharp teeth, and a variety of unnatural skin-tones.

While the existence of Tieflings can be a mystery, the most common theory is the Soul Reincarnation theory. In some cultures, when "sinners" go to Hell, they suffer the punishments of the plane for an eternity. In others, it is a intermediary before reincarnation. One scholar who has visited [[The Hells]] claimed they saw a sect of souls who only stay under punishment for only a short time, before they are slowly broken down into a base soul until they seem to vanish. They claim that those souls, in time, reincarnate into the Material Plane as Tieflings. This can explain how some Tieflings may be able to remember certain concepts without ever having been able to learn about it.
