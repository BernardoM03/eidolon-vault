## Names for NPCs
Kendon Kurzer

## Puzzle Notes
Humans are more likely to remember things that are associated with common symbols and objects. For example “pig” is more memorable than “truth.”

## Escanor and Rafi 
After the events of the party going to the South Point Lighthouse, the party allows Escanor and one of his crewmen off with their lives. The party should be able to run into these two later, perhaps changing their perspective on life a bit. For the meantime, he’s heading towards the city to finish off his last responsibilities. 

## A MLM Pyramid Scheme Guild
Children of Catameria, a guild of contractors under contractors that functions almost entirely like a pyramid scheme. Run by the fabulous Juliana Cromwell, a 70 year old female human merchant.

She has very long, braided, auburn hair and cyan eyes. She has rough white skin. She is slightly bow-legged and short. She proudly worships a God of hatred, fear and tyranny. (Lawful Evil). She is very selfish, materialistic, and lies about everything.

## NPC who is hard of hearing
He will say something, and when the party repeats it back to them, he will say “what are you saying.” After about 1 second, he’ll be like “Oh you meant [this]” and pronounce it the same exact way. 

Inspired by Cecil from D:OS1
