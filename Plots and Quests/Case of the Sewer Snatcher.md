A string of missing people has been happening in a sector with constant reports of a “monster” from the sewers. Postings have been set-up across the city, recruiting adventurers to help, but none seem to be accepting. The reason is a mix between the missing people being lower class (often residents of [[Dimming]]), low pay, and applications for [[The Winter Trials]] opening up soon.

The party gets introduced to the quest via a flyer, which is the first thing they encounter when they don’t have a task to complete. It will be heavily contrasted by the poster for [[The Winter Trials]]. The flyer contains the latest new story surrounding the Sewer Snatcher story, depicting Artos Lemm, a likeable figure that the party met on their way into the city.

Additionally, if the party attempts to go back to Gatebridge to find Artos Lemm, they will come into contact with Treighton Brumm, a half-orc member of the [[Stone Guard]]. He is quite the dick, acting rude to the party and making off comments about Artos. He knows that Artos Lemm hasn't come into work today, and laugh pointing at a nearby poster that has been hung up. "Seems like trouble always follows you if you're from that trash pile down under." Ultimately, Treighton doesn't know anything about the kidnapping other than some bloke has been attaching his own letters to each of the posters and that he was last seen after a night out with some of the other Stone Guard members of Gatebridge

The Sewer Snatcher is a criminal whose face is unknown, though rumors and evidence point in the direction of one entity. The common threads are that the associated kidnappings all take place around sewers near the surrounding regions of Dimming, and that none have been found. 

### The Flyer.
	MISSING, Artos Lemm
	The latest victim in the reign of the SEWER SNATCHER.
	Last seen in Catavale North.
	Below the text, someone has added a short line in smaller, cramped handwriting.
	If anyone can help, please contact: 1240 Mole Street.

Perpetrator.
Tal Snake-Eyes Enshi, a Capone of [[Big Chuck]]’s [[Gravel Rats]]. He recently gained information that Artos Lemm is an informant for the Fang that works at [[Gatebridge]]. This is bad for business, so it must be swiftly dealt with. Artos Lemm was taken by Snake-Eyes and his group of rats, bringing him in through the sewers 

## A Rocking Night Out
If the party attempts to find information about the missing Artos Lemm by looking for the other members of the Stone Guard he was out with, they can track down an NPC that was with Artos last night. This will need them to the Stone Gauntlet ([[Tavern]]) 

DC 10 Investigation: It takes you about 3 hours going in and out of various locations, finally stumbling across a tavern known as the Stone Gauntlet. 
DC 15 Investigation: You enter and investigate a few different locations of note for about an hour, before stopping in front of one establishment called the Stone Gauntlet in Catavale North.
DC 20 Investigation: Smartly, you know who to ask about where Stone Guard members go to drink on their time off, finding out they frequent the Stone Gauntlet, a tavern in Catavale North.

**Damay Bhobbub**: An older halfling woman, ex-soldier turned guard. She is a guard supervisor, and was the person just above Artos Lemm. She is an immigrant from the [[Rostran Empire]]. She is cynical and greedy, valuing gold and her own self-interests above most. Damay has ties with the Gravel Rats, and was the person who sold out Artos Lemm. She doesn't know where they took him, but if pressed by the party, will say she can find out if they don't turn her in. Given 4d6 hours, she can find the location of Artos Lemm via entrance C.

## 1240 Mole Street
This address is a small, modest, but well-kept home in [[Catavale North (Markets)]]. It stands out slightly from its neighbors. The stonework is repaired, the door recently replaced, and a small potted plant sits by the window. It is very comfortable and warm looking. 

When the party knocks at the door, an older man opens the door. His hands are dusted with a bit of white powder, as if he was in the middle of baking when you knocked. This is Artos Lemm’s father, Brent Lemm. He brightens up immediately if the party mentions they are here to talk about his son, whom he calls Arty. He insists they come inside. The space is warm and lived-in, with small comforts everywhere: Cushions, fresh-bread, and tea already steeping. 

As the party settles down, Brent is constantly talking about Brent, praising him about:
- How hard he works
- How proud he was when he bought the house
- How much he put the people close to him before himself
- How he had just gone out on a date with a nice girl, and how he’d been nervous in a way he hadn’t seen in years

When the party begins to question more about the case, Brent knows the following:
- He went out with his friends in Catavale North at the tavern The Stone Gauntlet, which is a favorite of members of the Stone Watch.
- Arty was excited because he felt he was finally warming up to the others in the [[Stone Guard]], despite the fact that he was previously a resident of Dimming
- He said he would be home late, but not too late, but never came back

Brent can also provide his collection of information. A stack of broadsheets on the coffee table are weighed down by a set of reading glasses. These newspapers are worn and creased by constant use. The articles aren’t by any big publications in the city, but by a local paper named Dimming Press by journalist Frankie Pierce. They provide the following information:
- Refer to the disappearances as the work of a “monster,” though no two descriptions agree
- Emphasize the victims low-class background, all having lived in Dimming at some point
- The Stone Watch has investigated multiple sewer access points, then quietly and abruptly stopped reporting on the matter

Brent will recommend they stop by the Dimming Press building on the northside of the [[Merial Docks]]. He will have a lot more information about the situation. 

A DC 15 insight check can reveal that Brent seems to be avoiding a topic of conversation. He is being incredibly helpful, but never mentions anything about not knowing a reason why he could be kidnapped, almost like he has a reasonable suspicion why that could be. 

- With a DC 20 persuasion, Brent can reveal that Arty is involved with [[The Fang]]. He never liked it, but it kept them fed and safe. He doesn’t do any more than be an informant nowadays, which Brent is incredibly proud of. Brent will say that he was likely targeted due to that connection, but not sure by who.  

Before the party leaves, he will press extra food into their hands. “Please, if you can, bring my boy home. You are the only ones who have stopped by.”

## Dimming Press and Mr. Pierce
Dimming Press operates out of a narrow, soot-stained building wedged between a shuttered cobbler and a boarded-up lending office at the northern edge of the [[Merial Docks]]. The sign above the door is hand-painted and uneven, the lettering touched up more than once. The door is closed. Knocking does not offer a response, but rather the party can see a light go out in the background. 

### Frankie Pierce.
Late 20s drow half-elf, ink-stained fingers, heavy eyebags, and hair pulled back.
Frankie is journalist, editor, publisher, and distributor of Dimming Press, a self-founding paper that tackles the issues important to the disenfranchised. Unfortunately, his work seems to upset more than inspire, as the [[Gravel Rats]], [[The Fang]], and [[Stone Guard]] all don’t like when information of their unjust practices come to life. He does have a few regular supporters, such as Artos Lemm and his father. 

Frankie believes that the party, who has knocked on the door of Dimming Press, is actually an enforcer sent to teach him a lesson. That is why he is currently hiding. With a successful DC 15 persuasion, the party can convince Frankie that they are innocent. They can also mention that they want to follow the Artos Lemm case, and he will come out immediately.

Walking inside the establishment, the smell of ink and damp parchment are omnipresent. A single press small press takes up one corner of the room. A few dozen broadsheets are bundled with twine and piled right next to it. Strung across the walls are hundreds of notes, maps, and half-written headlines that are pinned wherever there is space.  

Frankie speaks enthusiastically about the situation, stating the following information and answering questions:
- “The monster angle started as a rumor, it’s likely the effect of gang-disputes. These descriptions were printed because the witnesses were afraid, not because they were credible. Though, if I were to blatantly accuse the Fang or Gravel Rats, it’s my head”
- “Every disappearance though has happened near a sewer access point, all within a few blocks of known Gravel Rat territory”
- “Contacting the Stone Watch has been pointless at this point. They stopped answering questions about 1 week ago, and that was the same time they stopped investigating the sewers. Witnesses have also begun to refuse to talk”
- “This is bread and butter tactics for gang-wars, especially due to the rising power of Ward’s Gravel Rats. The Gravel Rats are taking out targets of interest without consequence from the police, either through bribes or insider corruption.
- “I can show you where one of the sewers one of the victims was kidnapped at, but be wary of these next steps. You could be making a big enemy for yourself if you are not careful.”
## Sewer Dungeon

![[Catamerian Sewer Dungeon.png]]
### A - Drop Shaft with Sludge Leak (entrance).
This room contains a vertical shaft coming down from the ceiling, bringing waste down from above. A large gash in the shaft has caused sludge to spew out, currently residing as a puddle on the ground. 
DC 10 Investigation: Multiple blobs stick out from under the tunnel. These are dead rats
DC 15 Investigation: Sludge stained footprints follow down west down this sewer. If anyone with magic investigates, they can sense magic from the sludge.

### B - Sediment Trap with Gold.
The chamber has the sewage tunnel widened into a shallow basin filled with thick, dark silt. Old scraps of wood, bone, and rusted metal lie half-buried beneath the muck. Small glints of light poke out from the muck. 95 gold pieces can be collected here

### C - Treatment Plant (entrance).
Large stone wheels (molded via magic) turn slowly in narrow channels, still grinding despite their age. The constant creak and churn of moving water echoes through the chamber. There are lots of shelves with alchemical components, ledgers, and documents

### D - Sewer Junction.
Several channels branch away from this junction, each carrying water at a slightly different pace

### E - Treatment Plant Abandoned (entrance).
Large stone wheels (molded via magic) stay still within narrow channels, no longer grinding. The surrounding machinery is silent, the only noise in the room being yourselves and the running sewage. One thing of note is the missing pieces to machinery. 
DC 15 Investigation: the missing components are cleanly dismantled from the larger machinery.

### F - Sewer Junction.
9 kobold workers are here. They are a maintenance crew for the sewers. 
They don’t know anything about the case of the Sewer Snatcher, because they just work here. They warn the party about the rats, but not about the gangs. If the party asks about the gangs, they will confirm they are there. The kobolds argue about whose turn it is to climb the shaft next. One complains about “rats stealing tools again.”

### G - Sewer Junction with a Wererat. 
A thick sludge blankets the sewage, trapping heavy debris from washing further through the canal. It takes a while to notice in this dark room, but In the corner, something crouches unnaturally still, watching.

This is a were-rat, and after a moment of unnatural twitching and screaming, it attacks the party. It cannot pass its lycanthropy, but it can disease the party. 

### H - Sewer Junction.
Within the chamber ahead, you hear the chittering of lots of rats. They scatter at first, heading into a hole in the wall. If the party heads forward, a wave of the chittering emerges again, followed by a deep growl. They  then surge back in force, a Massive Swarm of Rats.

### I - Outfall Chamber.
Wastewater pours through grated channels into a dark outflow beyond the city. Crates sit stacked along the walls, guarded by 3 people. They were dirty and worn clothes, almost like rags. 

They intimidate and threaten the party before drawing blades. They run as soon as they see they are outmatched. If the party searches through the crates here, they can use a crowbar located inside the room. The crates contain short swords, hand-crossbows, crossbow bolts, and lots of small vials of this translucent liquid (this is a highly addictive drug known as Pinktail).

### J - Gravel Rat Tunnel.
This narrow tunnel has been hacked through dirt and stone, held up by crude and uneven supports.

As the party walks down the tunnel, if the party has silently dealt with the rats in chamber I, one Gravel Rat Runner and one Gravel Rat Corner boss can be heard in the tunnel. If anyone in the party rolls below a 10 on stealth, the Gravel Rats start dashing towards. Chamber K. 

### K - Outfall Chamber.
Gravel Rat gang members here. This is a lab for the production of Pinktail. 

### L - Sediment Trap.
The chamber has the sewage tunnel widened into a shallow basin filled with thick, dark sludge. It smells foul. On the edges of the chamber, cages are placed, turning this room into a make-shift prison. The following prisoners are:

**Artos Lemm**: Not here, currently being interrogated by Snake-Eyes in Chamber O
[[Janshai Brichalon]]: Not here, currently working on a new batch of Pinktail in Chamber K
Chaos: A 191 y/o tiefling slaver with long braided hair, long nails, red skin, and dyed red hair. He is very talkative as the party passes by and flirts with the men of the group.
Jannas Gallath: a 42 y/o triton, very short, cropped green hair, missing an ear. He is very exhausted and dehydrated, with the environment in this sewer slowly killing him. He can be healed and given water, but that will just allow him the sleep he needs.
Emeline Drake: a 59 y/o human. She has an aloof face, but acts conceited and judgy to the party. She offers a discount on her goods if the party frees her. 
### M - Drop Shaft.
5  Gravel Rat Runners are located here

### N - Gravel Rat Snake-Eyes Lounge.
6 Elites under the command of Snake-Eyes are located here. They are lounging around, all sticking around for the next orders outside their leader’s main office. A fight is GUARANTEED to break out if the party makes their way here, as this has gone too far into Gravel Rat territory.

This will be a difficult fight, leading to the possibility of the players getting captured. See under "Captured by the Gravel Rats" for more

Encounter: 6x Snake-Eyes Elite Grunts and Tal “Snake-Eyes” Enshi

### O - Snake-Eyes Chamber.
This is the office of Tal "Snake-Eyes" Enshi, one of Big Chuck's main Capones. This office is quite gaudy

## Captured by the Gravel Rats
Once the party has been captured, they will be imprisoned for a while. Either Snake-Eyes or one another one of the Elite Grunts will state the following

	"Make sure those intruders are tied up properly and put them in the dead magic cages. After that, leave em alone for a few days and we can bring em to the boss"

After this, the party will be imprisoned in Room L. In the night, Gravel Rats members come back to escort [[Janshai Brichalon]] back to the cell. The party can talk with him to learn about Pinktail and his situation with the [[Gravel Rats]]. Artos Lemm never shows up.

After 2 days, some Gravel Rat members go to pick up the party. Unless the party find a way to feed themselves, they will all have 3 levels of exhaustion.
