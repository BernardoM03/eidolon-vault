This quest revolves around House [[Meredane]] and the eternal will of its founder [[Rennin Meredane]]. Rennin was a founder of Catameria, living roughly 5 centuries ago. He is thought to have died, as any mortal would, but Rennin has persisted. Just before his death, he transferred his soul into decorative coin and lived through that. This coin has been passed down House Meredane as a family heirloom. These preparations have all led to the coin ending in the hands of Rennin III Meredane, who is a warlock of his ancestor.
