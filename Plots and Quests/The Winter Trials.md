The Trials originated 147 years ago under King Lyle III. At that time, the king sought a method to measure the strength of adventuring parties without sending them away from the City. The Trials began as a series of duels and magical demonstrations, slowly evolving into the team-based combat of today. The introduction of the Royal Boon, a single wish or request granted by the Crown, solidified the Trials as the most influential martial festival in the kingdom.

In modern times, the Trials are a blend of politics, commerce, and spectacle. Noble Houses sponsor teams, merchants flood the arena district, and thousands gather to watch up-and-coming combatants display their potential. This year, the Winter Trials is officially recognizing contestants from [[Dimming]] as well, as a form of good will to the lower class.

The Trials take place over seven days. Competitors enter as groups of 2-5 adventurers (summons excluded). Teams are sorted into two divisions:
- Journeyman Division: rising adventurers, new companies, young nobles, military trainees
- Masters Division: veteran companies, House champions, and remote-region specialists  

The party qualifies for the Journeyman bracket and will compete during the same season as Ilya Tesseron, scion of House Tesseron and the favored contender. Finalists in either division earn the right to stand before the Merion monarchy and win the Royal Boon. This could be:
- A lump-sum of gold
- The acquisition of land or titles
- The lifting of curses and/or the prestige magical care
- Access to restricted archives or locations
- A choice of artifact from the Treasury of Castella Merion
- Retrieval of relics or lost family artifacts

Competitors must register within the week before the Winter Trials. The process includes an initial application, an interview/initial test, and then acceptance.

For the application, the teams must provide a group name, individual names, prior experience, and willingness for a short demonstration/interview. This short demonstration will require a combined skill-check, utilizing the highest ability score for a roll with advantage. This will determine the seeding process of the tournament. The higher the roll, the higher the seed, and the more likely they are to make it to the final rounds. 

## The Team Stages
All teams fight against monsters that increase in difficulty as the rounds progress. The first round is where most parties get eliminated. Depending on the number of contestants, this usually takes around 2 days. The second round gets tougher, eliminating another good portion of the groups. This round takes place in one day. The final round is the most difficult round, but the remaining groups are already the top performing talents. This round is a final test of strength, and the biggest show, taking place on the final day of the Team Stages. This stage is a preliminary event meant to test team work and fighting capabilities as adventurers historically do. Teams must provide for themselves, be responsible for their own health and safety, make their times on their own and provide themselves with all necessary equipment.

## Tournament Stages
Teams fight against each other. This stage shows the most talented groups, usually only a handful remaining. In this case, there will be 5 teams remaining, but the party will only have to fight two or three, depending on how close the third round fight was.

All of these teams now will be treated to the highest hospitality that [[Catameria]] has to offer, including having to stay at the [[Castella Grande]], a resort in the [[Verdure District]] that is commonly only offered to the richest merchants, diplomats, and nobles visiting Catameria.
