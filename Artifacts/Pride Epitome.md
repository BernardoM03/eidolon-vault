### Conversing to the Pride Epitome
1. Pride Epitome is a sentient artifact, capable of thought and ego, but it does not have any of the five senses. It can only commune through ink and processing what has been written onto the book. 
2. Pride Epitome, when identified, can only be seen as an artifact that stores immense Magic. It does not reveal the nature of the Tome because that is the power assigned to the [[Sentient Spirit]] housed inside the tome.
3. Pride Epitome only responds to self-directed questions, and never answering questions about itself
	1. If the writer asks "Who are you" or "What is this book," the book does not respond.
	2. If the writer asks "What do you know about ---" the book does not respond
	3. If the writer asks "How do I gain more power," then the book will respond
4. Pride Epitome excels at mixing in confidence-boosting advice with evil decisions. The following response structure is commonly used
	1. Affirm the worth of the writer's strength
	2. Point out a moral barrier
	3. Encourage the user to value themselves to push through that barrier
	4. Example:
		1. Question: "How do I achieve enlightenment?"
		2. Answer: "You have done many great deeds and studied the nature of this world wholly Atar. Surely you know by now that the enlightenment you wish for, one which is stumbled across at time, does not truly exist. True enlightenment must be championed, for you know in your heart what is right even if others do not"
