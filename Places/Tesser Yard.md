Tesser Yard sits on the outer flank of the Stone Crown and forms the city’s primary military quarter. The yard belongs to the noble house Tesseron, sworn to protect Catameria, a duty passed down through their line. The ward contains training grounds, armories, siege workshops, and stables for the city’s mounted divisions. Its soldiers patrol the walls, safeguard the roads leading into the city, and act as the monarch’s first line of defense.
