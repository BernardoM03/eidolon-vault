After the Gatebridge, the Commons opens into a broad expanse built to welcome travelers and present [[Catameria]] at its best. It is shaped by wide stone plazas, curated gardens, and towering statues of past rulers and mages. Murals painted on street stones depict the founding of the city and the early exploits of Cata Merion, the adventurer and first king of Catameria. Reflection pools catch the light from sunrise to dusk and create long, bright paths that point the eye toward the [[Stone Crown]] rising above the ward. 

### Foot Traffic to the City
Carts, wagons, and large shipments of goods are going into the south section of the city. Just below where you see the massive wall, you see the roofs of warehouses and towering cranes in [[Catavale South (Yards)]].

Workers on one section stand before the most gaudy section of the commons, a pathway that leads to the noisiest and brightest section of the city, [[The Promenade]]. Most of the tourists seem to be gravitating torwards there after seeing the sights of the Commons.

Heavy foot traffic goes on just above that, where plenty of citizens walk to and from, leading to the city center of [[Catavale North (Markets)]]

### Statues of Honor
At the north end of the Commons, there is a calmer garden-like area of the commons. This acre or two of land seems to be very well kept, with a small pathway circling a pond. Hundreds of life-size statues stand regally depicting the various leaders and cultural icons of the city every year. On the bases of each statue shows a name, a year, and an action. These are the Statues of Honor.
