After the Gatebridge, the Commons opens into a broad expanse built to welcome travelers and present [[Catameria]] at its best. It is shaped by wide stone plazas, curated gardens, and towering statues of past rulers and mages. Murals painted on street stones depict the founding of the city and the early exploits of Cata Merion, the adventurer and first king of Catameria. Reflection pools catch the light from sunrise to dusk and create long, bright paths that point the eye toward the [[Stone Crown]] rising above the ward.
