The Stone Crown is the highest and oldest ward in [[Catameria]], built on dark basalt ridges that overlook every other district. It is the seat of authority and tradition. Below the castle, terraced manors house Catameria’s oldest noble families. These estates are constructed from the same dark stone as the castle, and each family maintains its own small guard, archives, and private shrines. These lords advise the monarchy, influence policy, and control much of the wealth that flows through the city’s higher tiers. Their rivalries are understated but constant.
