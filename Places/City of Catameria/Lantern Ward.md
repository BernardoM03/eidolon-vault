A broad, mixed residential district known for its distinctive lighting traditions. Houses use a variety of metals for lanterns hanging from balconies, lintels, or street posts. These lanterns often indicate differences in socioeconomic status and culture. This is the prime residential neighborhood that most of [[Catameria]]’s citizens live in, ranging from modest middle-class homes to upper-middle-class estates.
