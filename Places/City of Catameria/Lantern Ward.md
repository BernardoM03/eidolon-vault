A broad, mixed residential district known for its distinctive lighting traditions. Houses use brass, tin, or colored-glass lanterns hanging from balconies, lintels, or street posts. These lanterns often indicate differences in socioeconomic status and culture. This is the prime residential neighborhood that most of [[Catameria]]’s citizens live in, ranging from modest middle-class homes to upper-middle-class estates.

Temples in this ward operate as both community anchors and organized institutions. They range from small sanctuaries dedicated to minor deities or sacred tenets to larger temples of the main pantheon. Their doors remain open late into the night, providing rites, counsel, guidance, and quiet spaces for residents when needed.
