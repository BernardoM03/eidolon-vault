Catavale South is the industrialized section of the city. Perfectly sectioned between the Merial Docks and Merion’s Gate Commons, allowing for convenient transportation of goods at both entrances. This is where goods and heavy trade must pass before reaching the open markets of [[Catameria]]. The loud noises of the Promenade and workers make it undesirable for living, making it available for low-income housing
Use: distribution yards, workshops, storage, bulk markets, industry
