Population: ~15,000

Dimming is the underbelly beneath the cracks that the rest of [[Catameria]] tries not to see. It is not an officially sanctioned section of Catameria. The area began centuries ago as a refuse zone beneath the [[Stone Crown]] and [[Verdure District]], a place where surplus goods, broken materials, and abandoned storage were pushed out of sight. Over time, the city’s poor found shelter in the gaps, first a few, then many, until a full, hidden ward took shape.

Like in its founding, life in Dimming is shaped by each individual’s resourcefulness. People repurpose discarded refuse from the upper wards into homes, tools, fabrics, and trade goods. Every child of every family knows how to patch, mend, and improvise.

Catameria does not officially recognize the district, and the [[Stone Guard]] does not patrol it. Residents build what they can from the discarded stone, timber, and scrap of the upper wards. Homes stack against one another. Entire streets twist in the narrow spaces between old supply tunnels, collapsed storage vaults, and forgotten drainage channels.

Crime families, gangs, and syndicates serve as the closest thing to governance. They control trade, settle disputes, and enforce their own laws. The Stone Crown pretends they do not exist while quietly engaging their services when needed, such as illegal exports, under-the-table work, and access to the black markets. At least under the law of Catameria, crime is a part of daily life, but Dimming isn’t governed or recognized by the city, so all is fair game. In the end, people treat it as a trade rather than a moral failure. Pickpockets work alongside carpenters and doctors, and the line between “business” and “trouble” is defined by whoever has control over the street.

Despite its dangers, it is crowded with people who cannot afford Catavale North/South or the Lantern Ward. Families, workers, and refugees from distant lands settle here because they have no other option. The ward generates constant pressure on the surrounding districts via thefts, smuggling, or gang conflict.

## Narrative
[[The Fang]] is historically the powerful crime syndicate in Dimming, existing for multiple generations. Currently, for the first time since taking power, they are losing the control to [[Big Chuck]]'s new [[Gravel Rats]]. Because of this, the Fang seems to be tightening control, promoting loyalists, and quietly removing weak links. This consolidation is a part of their patient strategy, Allowing Big Chuck to overextend, trusting his brutality to provoke backlash and end up leaking information. Once the information is leaked, they plan on using assassinations, blackmail, or proxy gangs to fracture Chuck’s Capones.

The Gravel Rats have been a symbol and group that have rebelled against institutions of power within Catameria. Now, Big Chuck has seen to turn the Gravel Rats into an institution of power itself, seeking to claim the life of luxury that he was denied by life. In turn, he has become the very same system, like the Stone Crown or the Fang, that oppresses others that were just like him. Followers of Big Chuck's Gravel Rats follow out of their self-interest to provide for themselves or others that need money, food, etc... There are also rebels, New Gravel Rats that fight against Chuck as well, seeing that he has become yet another oppressive force against the innocents of Dimming.

The [[Onyx Hand]] is still a mysterious order within dimming. The location is known to most, but what happens inside, is completely unknown. High order members of the Fang and likely Big Chuck know stories about the monk assassins (or possibly have experienced attacks), and are wary of their influence.

The people of Dimming are victims and perpetrators of this. There are very many who are innocent and suffer under the control of The Fang or Big Chuck. But there are also those, who in the short term can only see entering this life of criminality to provide for themselves or their family. The Fang and the Gravel Rats can provide real benefits that they wouldn't normally have, so it's a hard dilemma.
