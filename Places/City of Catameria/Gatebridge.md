Most journeys start here. It is the entry point from the outer lands of [[Catameria]] into the heart of its Capital. The Gatebridge is a narrow, bustling, fortified bridge and transit ward funneling travelers, traders, and immigrants into weighing stations, customs houses, and corral-yards large enough to hold entire wagon trains. Once complete, the city of Catameria awaits.

When passing through Gatebridge, visitors and travelers must provide: Name and origin, purpose of entry, intended lodging location, and declaration of goods including (arms, alchemical/arcane substances, and beasts of burden). Magical artifacts at the gate use scribed ledgers and divination to check for concealed magical compulsion, illusion, or curses. 

Those who are not citizens of Catameria must provide legal documentation of the type of visitation they fall under. The following options are available: 
- Visitor Badge; costs 1 gold; valid for 14 days (cannot be renewed immediately); cannot take formal employment, join a guild, lease property, or buy land.
- Work Ledger; costs 5 gold (usually paid by the guild or employer); valid for 12 months (can be renewed annually); requires sponsorship and proof of lodging
- Merion Adventurer Pass; free, but requires sponsorship by a recognized entity; valid for length of contracted service (4-12 weeks); this pass allows for carrying weapons and spell components
- Residency License; application costs 5 gold; requires a permanent address in one of the 5 residential districts of Catameria, proof of guild-membership or employment (or relation), takes 2-6 weeks to process; requires renewal every 5 years
