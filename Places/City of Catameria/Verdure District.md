The Verdure District is Catameria’s most refined residential ward and the seat of soft power. Situated at the northern-most area of Catameria, it is home to wealthy merchants, diplomats, accomplished arcanists, university faculty, and minor nobles. The architecture is polished but varied: ivy-covered villas, glass-roof atriums, curated gardens, and elegantly tiled courtyards.

The ward is quieter than the markets or docks, but far from lifeless. Tea-houses, salons, spellwork studios, and cultural clubs create a constant hum of social and intellectual exchange. Visitors often remark that the Verdure District feels like a curated interpretation of Catameria. It overlooks the Catavale Market and parts of the Lantern ward.
