Just within the city, from the docks and Gatebridge, is this stretch of debauchery. The Promenade is a wide commercial street filled with inns, alehouses, money-changers, bookmakers, entertainers, and services that prey on travelers with fresh coin. This is the tourist-trap of [[Catameria]]
Use: visitor spending, nightlife, rumor-mongering, crime.
