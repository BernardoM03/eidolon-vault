 
[[Brennly Wriggle]]'s is located in a northern neighborhood of the Lantern Ward known as [[Goodbarrel Ave]]. This home sports a uniquely crafted pewter lantern that he received as a gift. 

This house, like many in this section of the city, is crafted of wood and stone. Wood can be something of a luxury in this city, where the access to earth-shaping magic is second to none in the world. The foundation of the house is molded up with patterned stone pillars and slabs that accent the walls. Filled in between are long wooden planks, wattle, and daub. 

[[Andri]]. This house is "haunted" by a specter. He was a dwarf who lived here before, but died a mysterious death. His abnormally immense sense of pride and curiosity could not let him pass on to the next life without finding out what killed him.

## Layout

### Parlor Room
This abnormal reception room doesn't seem to be designed for socialization or displaying status, but rather to welcome Brennly in from a long journey. Two coat racks and a shoe-rack stand before the entrance step, leading into the main room. The walls are lined with book shelves, wall-shelves, and framed pictures of many different moments in Brennly's life. On one end of the room displays a cozy stone hearth with a halfling sized chair and a larger sofa. There are hundreds of books, primarily works of fiction or historical biographies.

### Dining Room / Kitchen
The other room on the first floor is a dining room and kitchen combo. This open floor plan consists of a furnace connected to a stove, dozens of kitchen utensils and pans hanging on the walls, a humble pantry that is neatly empty besides long-lasting foods, a magical "cooling-box", and a small dining table.
### Washroom
This dark room contains a wooden tub and a small iron stove with a kettle resting atop it, and a barrel under a spigot in the wall. This seems to magically produce water, that is heated by the kettle and drawn into the bath tub. 
### Bedroom
This room seems to be the most dreary in the house. This halfling-sized bed seems not to have been made before leaving, and plenty of the room seems to be dusty and unkept.

DC 15 Insight: Perhaps Brennly does not get the best sleep, at least he hasn't for a while.
### Study Cabinet
This cabinet seems to be used as Brennly's study room. The room seems to be furnished with books, works of art, and a variety of tools and magical artifacts that Brennly seems to have been studying. 

One group of items seems to be locked within boxes, that someone with magical studies under their belt can recognize as lead-boxes. These are specifically crafted boxes that are lined with lead to disrupt divination upon the artifact and magical-effects from the artifact.
