## City of Catameria
Catameria is the largest city in the south of Ennalis. It stands as an independent city-state, a functioning monarchy that rules the surrounding region. Catemeria lies in a temperate region, where traveling north brings warmer weather and traveling south leads to colder and foggier lands.

Founded in 684 PD (about 5 centuries ago) by Cata Merion, a legendary explorer, arcane practitioner, and a royal prince to the [[Kingdom of Asameria]], Catameria has grown into a center for adventurers, scholars, and magic. Wizards and arcanists hold respected roles in civic life and often serve as advisors to the throne. The culture of the city encourages curiosity, martial skill, and the pursuit of arcane knowledge, all traits linked to its founder.

Catameria remains a monarchy led by the descendants of Cata Merion. The city embraces a wide pantheon of gods, and worship is openly practiced across its wards. This moderately liberal governance keeps the city’s arcanists and adventurers satisfied, but the divide between its wealthy and its poor remains sharp.
