The Divine Empire of Greylinn is a ruined civilization that lasted over 1000 years, dating back to -2000PD to -800 PD. This country spanned nearly all of Western [[Ennalis]], where the [[Warring States]] currently reside. 
### The Grey King
Greylinn worshipped the Grey King, the holy emperor and Godking of the land. Not much is known about the Grey King, as his presence was heavily obscured, even within the capital of Palecrown. The Grey King was stated to be immortal, a god amongst men that would lead the good followers of Greylinn into the the Pale Gates, a heavenly paradise beyond death.
