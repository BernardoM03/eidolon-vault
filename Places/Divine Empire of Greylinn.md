The Divine Empire of Greylinn is a ruined civilization that lasted over 1000 years, dating back to -1200PD to 0 PD. This country spanned nearly all of Western [[Ennalis]], where the [[Warring States]] currently reside. 
### The Grey King
Greylinn worshipped the Grey King, the holy emperor and Godking of the land. Not much is known about the Grey King, as his presence was heavily obscured, even within the capital of Palecrown. The Grey King was stated to be immortal, a god amongst men that would lead the good followers of Greylinn into the the Pale Gates, a heavenly paradise beyond death. The Grey King is the only one allowed to be worshipped by the citizens of the Empire. Other spirits and deities exist, but worship or even continued contact, patronage, etc... is considered illegal.

Greylinn was surrounded on all sides by a massive wall that circled the entire empire. It was commonly considered a blessing to live inside this land, away from the evil outside the walls.
