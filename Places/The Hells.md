Slowly cultivated over hundreds of thousands of years of Collective Thought, this plane has been given the Identity simply explained as "an afterlife of punishment for sinners." In this case, a sinner can be defined as "one who transgresses divine, sacred, or cultural law through relatively immoral acts."

 Mortals who have perished and can be deemed as "sinners" to those around them, will gravitate to the Hells as an afterlife. There are multiple outcomes for those who have made it to Hell.
 - Some stay in Hell for an eternity of punishment
 - Some get reincarnated into the Material Plane as a "[[Tiefling]]"
 - Some stay in Hell and gain power, transforming into Devils

### Devils
As stated before, the Hells are a plane conceptualized as an afterlife of punishment for sinners. Generally, these sinners are bad people, but they can still be incredibly competent, intelligent, talented, and gifted with [[Magic]]. Those kinds of sinners, the ones with the ability to turn a bad situation into one that favors themselves, managed to become the first Devils and rule the Hells with an iron fist.

Since then, Devils and the Hells have evolved by a lot. As stated by the 2024 5.5E DMG:
```
It is the ultimate plane of law and evil, and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. The devils of the Hells are bound to obey the laws of their superiors, but they squabble within their individual castes. Most undertake any plot, no matter how foul, to advance themselves.
```

There are four categories of devils, ranging from puny spawn lings to God-like immortals.
1. Lesser Devils, weak and tiny devils such as lemures and imps
2. Devils, common devils such as Chain Devils and Harvester Devils
3. Greater Devils, Distinguished Elites such as Rakshasas and Pit Fiends
4. Archdevils, God-like devils that rule different sections of Hell
