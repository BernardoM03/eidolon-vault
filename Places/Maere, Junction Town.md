## The Stonewatch Outpost  
A compact, stone-faced outpost run by rotating Catamerian soldiers. It serves as an inspection point, message relay, and law keeping station for travelers headed toward the capital.

Keeper on Duty: Warden Serali Durn, a tired but sharp half-elf woman who has worked this junction for far too many seasons and has opinions about everyone on the road.
## The Bending Willow
This inn is a two-story half-timbered building, with a thatched roof and unusually high ceilings. Accommodations consist of several small rooms with wooden cots. The inn is widely known for its adventuring patrons. The innkeeper is an old male dwarf named Fari. He has an identical twin named Bari, who works opposite shifts.

The common room is long and warm. Exposed beams run high overhead, giving the space an airy hall-like feel unusual for an inn. The tables throughout the room are mismatched but sturdy pieces, seemingly collected over decades. The air smells of stewed vegetables, pine smoke, and ale.
## Gristle & Grain General Store
A squat, clay-brick shop with bundles of dried herbs hanging from the rafters and rows of practical goods stacked with meticulous care.

Owner: Merrin Gristle, a middle-aged half-orc with a gravelly voice and a practiced merchant’s smile. He buys and sells almost anything that fits in a pack.

Items for sale:
- Trail rations, smoked meats, dried fruits
- Bedrolls, rope, lantern oil, needles, thread
- Cheap charms said to “ward off forest curses”
- A small shelf of adventuring miscellany recovered by locals from the roadside
- A cheap but potent herbal liquor distilled by townsfolk from willow bark and meadowflowers. Restores 1d4 HP when drunk during a short rest. Tastes awful.
