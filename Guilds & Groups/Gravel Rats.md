Historically, the Gravel Rats are a disorganized, resentful, and punk-like gang of [[Dimming]]. They are often Dimming’s restless youth, rebelling against the monarchy of [[Catameria]] and [[The Fang]]. They form small “burrows,” each with its own loyalty structure, and they are constantly shifting, merging, arguing, and dissolving. More recently, power has begun solidifying under influence of one charismatic and terrifying [[Big Chuck]]. There are also various smaller gangs that are also considered Gravel Rats, and have begun fighting against the Stone Crown, the Fang, and Chuck’s branch of the Rats. 

### Charles “Big Chuck” Ward.
Charles Ward is the most successful and powerful leader of the Gravel Rats, turning what is normally a disorganized, resentful, and punk-like group of Dimming’s young population into a criminal organization that rivals, and more recently, exceeds the Fang. He rules the criminal underground with an iron fist. Most illicit goods and activities on the streets can be traced back to him in some way, and he has no patience for people who can’t pay their debts. If they don’t pay up, their organs or body parts will be sold to make up the difference. Often in the underground parts of the city, you can find people with missing fingers, a missing eye, limbs, or scars from organs being harvested. Ward’s business is managed by subgroups of Capones and their henchmen.

### Tal ‘Snake Eyes’ Enshi. 
*A Yuan-ti pureblood with more obvious snake-like eyes and a soft-rasping voice*
He is in charge of running illicit substances through the city. They know every nook, cranny, and alleyway in the area, often utilizing the sewers to move their goods. He has insider connections to the Fang, allowing Ward and his rats to get the upper-hand on most info between the gang-disputes.

### Edward Crowley.
*An Aarakocra with oily black feathers, a scar over his eye and beak, and a nasally voice*
He is in charge of the manufacture and distribution of enchanted and magical items, trafficking them over great distances with him and his specialty squad Murderers’ ability to fly.

### Brim ‘Stonecrusher’ Orson.
*A dwarf with heavy burn scars, a shattered nose, and a gruff voice*
He is in charge of weapons dealings, forges weapons that rival even the best smiths and manufacturers.

### Malsael the Banished One.
*A Cambion with infernal tattoos marked all over his body, speaks few words*
They are pacted to Ward, and handle debt collection, taking debtors, bringing them to meet Charles, and taking assets to pay debt off.

### Fortuna Mortem.
*A human who is unhealthily skinny with immaculately gaudy clothes and a permanent smile*
He runs illicit gambling rings, including horse races. Allegedly uses mimics under his control to rig games. 

### Rat Runner.
The lowest rung in the Gravel Rat hierarchy. These are usually teenagers or young adults who are fast, small, and desperate. Most carry simple knives or slings. Loyalty is thin at this level, and it is often bought with daily expenses.

### Rat Cornerboss.
A step above the runners. These members have proven their ability and loyalty, or at least their silence, against Big Chuck. These cornerbosses manage a specific assigned alley or tunnel,  passing instructions down to runners, collecting payments from within the burrow, and keeping general eyes. They are often missing fingers, teeth, or bearing visible scars, as Big Chuck’s rule means failure is punished hard. 

### Pinktail.
A highly addictive drug that has been recently invented by [[Janshai Brichalon]], an aging half-orc alchemist captive by Big Chuck.
