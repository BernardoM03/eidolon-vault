**Symbol: Silver Fang over a black background

A dynastic crime family in [[Catameria]] under the leadership of Lady Sesharra Usah. The Fang are the aristocracy of [[Dimming]]. Their control is built on networks of money, influence, blackmail, and long-term manipulation. Dozens of [[Stone Guard]], members of the noble houses, and businesses on the street are either paid by or in debt to the Fang. Members of the Fang must follow these three rules, stated upon initiation.

1. Contracts are what define honor and trust
2. Secrets are as valuable as gold
3. Never insult the Usah

Once initiated, they join structured crews that patrol and enforce the streets of Dimming. They are often well-fed, well-armed, and noticeably better off than the average resident. The Fang is ordered into a hierarchy, where loyalty and results matter above all else. This means that anyone that aligns themselves with the goals of The Fang and devote their lives can rise in the ranks. Grunts are beneath Enforcers, who are beneath Merra Suhlee, who is beneath Lady Sesharra.

### Lady Sesharra Usah of the Fang
A tall yuan-ti pureblood woman in her early 60s with thin silver hair and a smooth unreadable face. She speaks softly with a calm, unhurried cadence. She oversees all Fang operations and makes major political decisions in Dimming. She was married to Theklu Usah, but had him killed. Her relationship with her children is rocky, but as she will still provide the love and protection of a mother, they will still offer her the respect she deserves as head of the Fang.
Magic Items: Dagger of Venom, Wakened Scaled Ornament (poison), Skull Card (Poison)

### Vethis Usah, Heir to the Fang
A tall and lean yuan-ti pureblood man in his early 30s with sharp eyes and carefully tied back black hair. Has a precise way of speaking that borders on condescension. He is the heir apparent to Lady Sesharra, next in line to being head of the Fang. He is married to Iztlia Usah, a yuan-ti pureblood from the Oasis of Kargoll. They have two boys, an 11 year old and an 8 year old. 

### Merra Suhlee, Captain of the Fang Enforcers
Broad-shouldered yuan-ti pureblood woman in her 50s with a scar across her lip and braided hair. Underneath her clothes, she has a deep and traumatic arcane burn, a symbol of her disgust and aversion to magic. She speaks bluntly, never wastes words, and always maintains eye contact. She commands the Fang’s street crews and martial grunts. She is a close friend to Lady Sesharra, they have known each other for over 40 years. 
Magic Items: +2 Serpent’s Fang, +1 Serpent Scale Armor,

### Fang Grunt
Lowest rank of Fang hierarchy. This can be practically any NPC with a bandit stat-block, but Humans, Yuan-ti, Tieflings, Dragonborn, Halflings, and Orcs are common. 

### Fang Enforcer.
Enforcers command small crews, collect dues, enforce contracts, and serve as the public face of Fang authority in Dimming. They are typically well-built men and women in their 30s to 50s wearing clean insignia, fitted serpent-armor, and carrying maintained weapons. 

### The Old Sluice.
A bar at the north west corner of [[The Promenade]]. This is quite the regular tavern, but hidden underneath is another, finer, more criminal lounge by the name of “The Viper’s Nest.” This acts as the work place for the Fang, for members and mercenaries to gather, relax, and get assigned new tasks. The current password is I’ve come to renegotiate our deal, and rarely changes. 

### The Usah Estate. 
Despite their control of Dimming, the Usah’s do in fact own an estate in the [[Verdure District]]. This is a very opulent manor, one of the larger in the neighborhood, but doesn’t really feel like a “home.” Lady Sesharra, Vethis and his family, and other members of the Usah family live here. There is a teleportation circle within the basement that is connected to the Old Sluice, which allows the family to navigate through the city quickly and quietly.**
