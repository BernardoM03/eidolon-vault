## Magic and the Soul

Matter and energy are not the only forms of existence in the world. Alongside both lies another that scholars simply call [[Magic]]. This essence explains all supernatural phenomena, including souls, spirits, and spell craft. Magic in its raw state is diffuse, but when manipulated can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, when it is concentrated and bound to a stable [[Identity]], it forms what is commonly understood as a Soul. Souls can be anchored to living beings, which produces mortal life, or they can exist free of the body as independent Spirits.

## Spirits and Identity
Spirits arise from Magic condensing around an [[Identity]]. Identity is the pattern or narrative that defines a thing. Scholars divide spirits into two categories: [[Natural Spirit]] and [[Sentient Spirit]].

## Divinity as Religion
Religion cultivates a set of core principles: stories, symbols, virtues, fears, and moral narratives. These ideas form an Identity that can slowly personify as a [[Sentient Spirit]]. As worship grows, the identity stabilizes. When it becomes dense enough, a spirit develops consciousness and agency. This being becomes recognized as a God. Religious practice therefore has two functions in terms of Magic Theory:

- It gives form to spirits created through belief.
- It continuously reinforces and reshapes those spirits through ongoing practice.

Prayers, rituals, sacrifices, and myths project the shared identity of a community toward the deity. This strengthens the deity’s soul and expands its capacity to influence the world. Followers, when practiced, can gain access to pools of Magic held by the divine-spirit. The caster’s soul aligns with the deity’s identity strongly enough to draw upon its power. Losing faith disrupts that connection. Reinforcing faith strengthens it. 

Religion can even be applied to manipulate the spiritual identity of a [[Natural Spirit]]. Many of these cases are referred to as “Ancient Gods,” who are spirits that embody landmasses such as a Mountain or a Forest. Millennia of worship would have layered cultural identity upon them. While their cores remain rooted in natural patterns, religion has given them personalities, motives, and anthropomorphized traits. A mountain may have once been an impassive yet powerful wellspring of natural Magic, but after centuries of being revered as a guardian spirit, it may now manifest and act as one. This spirit can now further evolve based on how ideas, worship, and culture around the mountain change. This relationship can exist in a two-sided manner, where people shape the gods through belief, and in turn, gods shape the people through acts.

Divinity and powerful Sentient Spirits can also be represented in different ways across cultures. An ancient civilization once may have worshipped a God, but fractured into two divided and warring kingdoms. The shared god is now worshipped by sworn enemies with different values, which is represented to each culture in their own way.
## Planar Theory

Scholars describe Planes of Existence as vast Sentient Spirits: world-sized souls shaped by Collective Thought on a scale that combines all mortal culture. 
- The Hells arise from the combined cultural ideas surrounding the punishment of sin: a realm filled with sinners
- The Heavens form from ideals of rewarding virtue, innocence, and the higher ideal of self: a realm for those who lived life to the best of their ability
- The Feywild manifests from the universal sense of wonder stoked by fairytales and child-like imagination: a realm defined by wondrous creatures, wild emotion, and boundless creativity
- The Shadowfell is built on top of every mortal’s collective fear of death, grief of loss, and stress against oblivion: a realm of horrific creatures that dwells in nightmares, darkness, and decay.

A Plane of Existence can influence the mortal world as well. Dreams and Nightmares are commonly interpreted as planar bleed. Planar beings can also gain sentience, such as Devils, Fairies, and powerful Undead. These creatures become powerful Sentient Spirits or even just regular mortals that can interact, live, and exist within the universe.

Mortals often enter a plane through the afterlife. When a soul leaves its body, it gravitates toward the realm whose Identity most closely matches its life. Souls who followed the ideals gravitate towards the Heavens. Tormented souls fall into the Hells, being reborn as a Devil or Demon. Fearful or unresolved souls drift toward the Shadowfell to live as a ghost.

## Glossary

Magic: A universal essence alongside matter and energy. It is the substrate from which supernatural elements can arise, and is commonly connected to Identity. 

Soul: A concentration of Magic tied to a stable and powerful Identity. Souls in living beings produce mortal life. Independent souls are Spirits.

Spirit: An independent soul. Spirits commonly have very powerful Identities, 

Sentient Spirit: A spirit formed from the ideas, emotions, fears, and beliefs of sentient beings. This can be done via powerful emotions or Collective Thought, both which have strong influence on Identity. 

Collective Thought: A shared belief, concept, or feeling amongst a group. This is capable of creating and manipulating Identity

Natural Spirit: A spirit formed from the Identity of natural phenomena. Mountains, seas, storms, forests, and seasons can all manifest as Natural Spirits. Their identities change slowly when influenced by human belief, gaining traits of Sentient Spirits.

Ancient God: A Natural Spirit heavily shaped by a long period of cultural worship through Collective Thought. They maintain a natural identity, but have adopted personified qualities based on the beliefs of cultures that revered them.
