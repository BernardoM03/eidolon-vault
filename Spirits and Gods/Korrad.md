Korrad is an Old God, a natural spirit of Mount Korrad, a dormant volcano located in the south-east of Ennalis. Korrad is worshipped by the Goliath tribes of the mountains. 

The goliaths believe that Korrad is a guardian spirit that is said to have blessed them. This blessing allowed them the strength to wrestle powerful beasts and a stone-like carapace to become hard as the mountain itself; To help them adapt to wherever in the world they were.
