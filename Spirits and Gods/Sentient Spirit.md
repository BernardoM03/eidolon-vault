Sentient minds generate impressions, beliefs, fears, stories, and rituals. These create Identity, which can shape existing spirits or give rise to entirely new ones. Here are a few examples:
### Emotion-Born Spirits.
A Revenant may form when overwhelming hatred or grief radiates from a being with the talent of Magic, shaping the Soul into a Spirit that can satisfy these powerful emotions. 
### Ascended Beings.
A mortal leader worshiped as a God-King may gradually accumulate collective identity so strong that their soul changes. They do not fully leave mortality, but they become part-spirit, sustained by the belief of their people.
### Deities.
When a unified group cultivates a shared idea, ritual, or philosophy, that identity can generate a new spirit entirely, a Deity or God. 

The rise of sentience changed the balance of the supernatural world. Natural Spirits embody stable patterns of nature. Sentient Spirits embody the instability and creativity of thought. Divinity emerges where collective identity becomes powerful enough to create self-aware, independent spirits that can act beyond their origin, often still embodying the traits assigned to the Identity.

The function of divinity, souls, and sentience are commonly debated amongst theological and philosophical lenses. Some scholars argue that humanity did not create these spirits but instead awoke the latent capacity of Magic to respond to narrative identity. Others claim humanity itself evolved because early life bonded with drifting fragments of natural spirit-stuff, forming the first souls capable of introspection.
