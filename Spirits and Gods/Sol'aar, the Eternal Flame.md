Sol'aar, the Eternal Flame is a Sentient Spirit, classified as a minor deity. Sol’aar emerged from an intellectual movement. Inspired by breakthroughs in research surrounding spirits and cosmology, an early transcontinental fellowship of researchers and philosophers envisioned an ideal: The Eternal Flame, a symbol that embodies the spark of curiosity, the pursuit of truth, and fight against the unknown.  

The academics that follow this god are known as the Scholars of the Eternal Flame. Throughout Aurelon, they have temples with about a dozen or so local or missioned Firewrights that work and study within the region. These temples are a decentralized network of academics, tutors, and other professions concerning knowledge.

Membership is open to all, but it's strict nature and steep barrier of entry often leads the scholars to rarely take on new recruits. The inner order is often seen as elitist and dogmatic by the general public.

Core Tenets.
1. Spread knowledge so that those who know may be uplifted by the teachings of Sol’aar
2. Conduct yourself with chivalry and honor, respecting those whom you meet regardless of creed.
3. Give only what could not harm. To recklessly enlighten those who wish to bring forth The Quiet Dark would bring ruin to the teaching and law of Sol’aar
